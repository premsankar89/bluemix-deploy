Familiarizing yourself with these unique characteristics will provide an optimal driving experience from your new vehicle.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe engine may not start because this vehicle is equipped with silent key start. This fuel saving feature allows your vehicle to be ready–to–drive without requiring the gas engine to be running. This indicator will remain on while the vehicle is on, whether the engine is running or not to indicate the vehicle is capable of movement (using its electric motor, engine, or both). Typically, the engine will not start unless the vehicle is cold, a climate control change is requested, or the accelerator is pressed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDriving: The gas engine automatically starts and stops to provide power when needed and to save fuel when not needed. While coasting at low speeds, coming to a stop, or standing, the gas engine normally shuts down and the vehicle operates in electric-only mode.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStopping: The gas engine may shut off to conserve fuel as you come to a stop. Restarting the vehicle is not required. Simply step on the accelerator when you are ready to drive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTransmission Operation: Due to the technologically advanced, electronically-controlled continuously variable transaxle, you will not feel shift changes like those of a non-hybrid vehicle.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNeutral: It is not recommended to idle the vehicle in position N for an extended period of time because this will discharge your high voltage battery and decrease fuel economy. The engine will not start or stop, and cannot provide power to the hybrid system in position N.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLow Gear: Low gear (position L) is designed to mimic the enhanced engine braking available in non-hybrid vehicles. Low gear will produce high engine speeds to provide necessary engine braking. This is normal and will not damage your vehicle. In low gear, the gas engine will remain on more often than in position D.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReverse: In position R, vehicle speed is limited to 22 mph (35 km/h).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour vehicle behaves differently compared to a non-hybrid. Here is a description of the major differences:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBattery: Your hybrid is equipped with a high voltage battery. A cool battery ensures battery life and provides the best possible performance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe high voltage battery is cooled by cabin air pulled into the high voltage battery through vents in the rear package tray. Avoid placing objects on the package tray that could block airflow through the vents.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEngine: The engine speed in your hybrid is not directly tied to your vehicle speed. Your vehicle\u0027s engine and transmission are designed to deliver the power you need at the most efficient engine speed. During heavy accelerations, your hybrid may reach high engine speeds (up to 6000 RPM).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn prolonged mountainous driving, you may see the engine tachometer changing without your input. This is intentional and maintains the battery charge level. You may also notice during extended downhill driving that your engine continues to run instead of shutting off.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring this engine braking, the engine stays on, but it is not using any fuel. You may also hear a slight whine or whistle when operating your vehicle. This is the normal operation of the electric generator in the hybrid system.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring certain events (such as vehicle servicing) your low voltage 12-volt battery may become disconnected or disabled. Once the battery is reconnected and after driving the vehicle, the engine may continue to operate for three to five seconds after the key is turned to off. This is a normal condition.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBraking: Your hybrid is equipped with standard hydraulic braking and regenerative braking. Regenerative braking is performed by your transmission and it captures brake energy and stores it in your high voltage battery.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour fuel economy should improve throughout your hybrid\u0027s break-in period. As with any vehicle, your driving habits and accessory usage can significantly impact your fuel economy. For best results, keep in mind these tips:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour vehicle will recognize your frequent destinations and allow for more EV driving as you approach them. For example, when nearing your home it should be easier to stay in electric mode. The EV indicator will display EV+ when this mode is active. You should see this about 1/8 mile (200 meters) from a frequent destination. See Information Displays. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou must plug in your Fusion Energi vehicle regularly for optimal use of the high voltage battery\u0027s extended range capability. When you charge your vehicle, you add electrical energy that is then used to propel the vehicle in plug-in power mode. You can view your estimated electric range on the Energy Use screen on the left-hand information display. You can also configure MyView to include detailed vehicle range information. See Information Displays.  The system maximizes the use of electric-only operation in plug-in power mode. System conditions may require engine operation; however, the system uses plug-in power whenever possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen your plug-in power has been depleted, the powertrain system will automatically switch to hybrid mode. Your battery gauge will transition to a simple battery graphic upon entering hybrid mode. Hybrid mode uses both the gasoline engine and electric motor to power your vehicle and maximize fuel economy as with Fusion Hybrid.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese modes are available when the vehicle can run under high voltage battery power. With the vehicle in driving mode, you can change EV modes with each press of the EV button. The current mode displays in the left hand instrument cluster screen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe vehicle may automatically enter Engine Enabled mode if system conditions require it. A message Engine Enabled for System Performance will display if this occurs. This is normal function, and your vehicle will return to EV Now when possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe vehicle may enter Enable Engine mode if the climate control is in a defrost mode and the outside temperature is cold. A message Engine Enabled Due to Defrost will display if this occurs. If defrost is not needed, select a different climate control mode to permit EV Now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you enable EV Now, a blue EV icon displays in the left-hand information display. If the vehicle is in the Engine Enabled mode, the EV icon will be yellow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEV Now will automatically exit when the Plug in power has been depleted.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you enable EV Later, a white EV Later icon appears on the left-hand information display.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe EV Later mode will automatically reset to EV Auto mode when you power the vehicle off. You may press the EV button twice during the next drive to return to EV Later mode, if desired.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe system saves vehicle energy by relaxing acceleration, compared to standard cruise control which only maintains speed. For example your vehicle may temporarily lose speed when going uphill. When set on, ECO will appear in the information display when cruise control is switched on. You can switch this on or off in the settings menu.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe low engine use mode is equipped on Fusion Energi models only. The low engine use mode will activate automatically when you drive your vehicle with limited engine use. The mode will maintain proper engine lubrication at sufficient temperature. If your vehicle is in low engine use mode when you start the vehicle, a message will appear in the information display. When your vehicle is in low engine use mode, your vehicle will automatically run the engine as necessary. If you select the EV Now mode while the vehicle is in the low engine use mode, EV Now mode will be suspended for as long as you are in low engine use mode. The low engine use mode will resume the next time you start your vehicle and will automatically stop when no longer needed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSee  Fuel Quality. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEcoSelect is a drive mode for non-plugin vehicles designed to offer the best possible fuel economy with only a slight impact to vehicle performance and comfort.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA graphic displays on your information display when EcoSelect is active.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour vehicle will remember the last selected mode between key cycles.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e","sourceUrl":"http://www.fordservicecontent.com/Ford_Content/vdirsnet/OwnerManual/Home/Content?bookCode\u003dO28450\u0026languageCode\u003den\u0026marketCode\u003dUS\u0026viewTech\u003dIE\u0026chapterTitleSelected\u003dG1518946\u0026subTitleSelected\u003dG1681110\u0026topicHRef\u003dG1681111\u0026div\u003df\u0026vFilteringEnabled\u003dTrue","contentHtml":"\u003cp\u003eThis hybrid vehicle combines electric and gasoline propulsion to provide breakthrough performance and improved efficiency.

This indicator will remain on while the vehicle is on, whether the engine is running or not to indicate the vehicle is capable of movement (using its electric motor, engine, or both). Typically, the engine will not start unless the vehicle is cold, a climate control change is requested, or the accelerator is pressed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eDriving:\u003c/b\u003e The gas engine automatically starts and stops to provide power when needed and to save fuel when not needed. While coasting at low speeds, coming to a stop, or standing, the gas engine normally shuts down and the vehicle operates in electric-only mode.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eStopping: \u003c/b\u003e The gas engine may shut off to conserve fuel as you come to a stop. Restarting the vehicle is not required. Simply step on the accelerator when you are ready to drive.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eTransmission Operation:\u003c/b\u003e Due to the technologically advanced, electronically-controlled continuously variable transaxle, you will not feel shift changes like those of a non-hybrid vehicle.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eNeutral:\u003c/b\u003e It is not recommended to idle the vehicle in position \n\u003cb\u003eN\u003c/b\u003e for an extended period of time because this will discharge your high voltage battery and decrease fuel economy. The engine will not start or stop, and cannot provide power to the hybrid system in position \n\u003cb\u003eN.\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eLow Gear:\u003c/b\u003e Low gear (position \n\u003cb\u003eL\u003c/b\u003e) is designed to mimic the enhanced engine braking available in non-hybrid vehicles. Low gear will produce high engine speeds to provide necessary engine braking. This is normal and will not damage your vehicle. In low gear, the gas engine will remain on more often than in position \n\u003cb\u003eD.\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eReverse:\u003c/b\u003e In position \n\u003cb\u003eR\u003c/b\u003e, vehicle speed is limited to 22 mph (35 km/h).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYour vehicle behaves differently compared to a non-hybrid. Here is a description of the major differences:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eBattery:\u003c/b\u003e Your hybrid is equipped with a high voltage battery. A cool battery ensures battery life and provides the best possible performance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe high voltage battery is cooled by cabin air pulled into the high voltage battery through vents in the rear package tray. Avoid placing objects on the package tray that could block airflow through the vents.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eEngine:\u003c/b\u003e The engine speed in your hybrid is not directly tied to your vehicle speed. Your vehicle\u0027s engine and transmission are designed to deliver the power you need at the most efficient engine speed. During heavy accelerations, your hybrid may reach high engine speeds (up to 6000 RPM).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn prolonged mountainous driving, you may see the engine tachometer changing without your input. This is intentional and maintains the battery charge level. You may also notice during extended downhill driving that your engine continues to run instead of shutting off.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDuring this engine braking, the engine stays on, but it is not using any fuel. You may also hear a slight whine or whistle when operating your vehicle. This is the normal operation of the electric generator in the hybrid system.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDuring certain events (such as vehicle servicing) your low voltage 12-volt battery may become disconnected or disabled. Once the battery is reconnected and after driving the vehicle, the engine may continue to operate for three to five seconds after the key is turned to off. This is a normal condition.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eBraking:\u003c/b\u003e Your hybrid is equipped with standard hydraulic braking and regenerative braking. Regenerative braking is performed by your transmission and it captures brake energy and stores it in your high voltage battery.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYour fuel economy should improve throughout your hybrid\u0027s break-in period. As with any vehicle, your driving habits and accessory usage can significantly impact your fuel economy. For best results, keep in mind these tips:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYour vehicle will recognize your frequent destinations and allow for more EV driving as you approach them. For example, when nearing your home it should be easier to stay in electric mode. The EV indicator will display EV+ when this mode is active. You should see this about 1/8 mile (200 meters) from a frequent destination. See\u0026nbsp;\n\u003cb\u003eInformation Displays\u003c/b\u003e.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou must plug in your Fusion Energi vehicle regularly for optimal use of the high voltage battery\u0027s extended range capability. When you charge your vehicle, you add electrical energy that is then used to propel the vehicle in plug-in power mode. You can view your estimated electric range on the Energy Use screen on the left-hand information display. You can also configure MyView to include detailed vehicle range information. See\u0026nbsp;\n\u003cb\u003eInformation Displays\u003c/b\u003e.\u0026nbsp; The system maximizes the use of electric-only operation in plug-in power mode. System conditions may require engine operation; however, the system uses plug-in power whenever possible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen your plug-in power has been depleted, the powertrain system will automatically switch to hybrid mode. Your battery gauge will transition to a simple battery graphic upon entering hybrid mode. Hybrid mode uses both the gasoline engine and electric motor to power your vehicle and maximize fuel economy as with Fusion Hybrid.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese modes are available when the vehicle can run under high voltage battery power. With the vehicle in driving mode, you can change EV modes with each press of the EV button. The current mode displays in the left hand instrument cluster screen.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe vehicle may automatically enter Engine Enabled mode if system conditions require it. A message \n\u003cb\u003eEngine Enabled for System Performance\u003c/b\u003e will display if this occurs. This is normal function, and your vehicle will return to EV Now when possible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe vehicle may enter Enable Engine mode if the climate control is in a defrost mode and the outside temperature is cold. A message \n\u003cb\u003eEngine Enabled Due to Defrost\u003c/b\u003e will display if this occurs. If defrost is not needed, select a different climate control mode to permit EV Now.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen you enable EV Now, a blue EV icon displays in the left-hand information display. If the vehicle is in the Engine Enabled mode, the EV icon will be yellow.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEV Now will automatically exit when the Plug in power has been depleted.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen you enable EV Later, a white EV Later icon appears on the left-hand information display.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe EV Later mode will automatically reset to EV Auto mode when you power the vehicle off. You may press the EV button twice during the next drive to return to EV Later mode, if desired.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe system saves vehicle energy by relaxing acceleration, compared to standard cruise control which only maintains speed. For example your vehicle may temporarily lose speed when going uphill. When set on, ECO will appear in the information display when cruise control is switched on. You can switch this on or off in the settings menu.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe low engine use mode is equipped on Fusion Energi models only. The low engine use mode will activate automatically when you drive your vehicle with limited engine use. The mode will maintain proper engine lubrication at sufficient temperature. If your vehicle is in low engine use mode when you start the vehicle, a message will appear in the information display. When your vehicle is in low engine use mode, your vehicle will automatically run the engine as necessary. If you select the EV Now mode while the vehicle is in the low engine use mode, EV Now mode will be suspended for as long as you are in low engine use mode. The low engine use mode will resume the next time you start your vehicle and will automatically stop when no longer needed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSee\u0026nbsp; \n\u003ca class\u003d\"copylink\" href\u003d\"Content?bookCode\u003dO28450\u0026amp;languageCode\u003dEN\u0026amp;marketCode\u003dUS\u0026amp;vCode\u003d\u0026amp;vFilteringEnabled\u003dTrue\u0026amp;subTitleSelected\u003dG1739546\u0026amp;chapterTitleSelected\u003dG1518948\u0026amp;topicHRef\u003dG1739547\u0026amp;viewTech\u003dIE\u0026amp;div\u003df\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eFuel Quality\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEcoSelect is a drive mode for non-plugin vehicles designed to offer the best possible fuel economy with only a slight impact to vehicle performance and comfort.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA graphic displays on your information display when EcoSelect is active.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYour vehicle will remember the last selected mode between key cycles.\u003c/p\u003e"},{"id":102,"title":"Safety Precautions","body":"","sourceUrl":"http://www.fordservicecontent.com/Ford_Content/vdirsnet/OwnerManual/Home/Content?bookCode\u003dO28450\u0026languageCode\u003den\u0026marketCode\u003dUS\u0026viewTech\u003dIE\u0026chapterTitleSelected\u003dG1518948\u0026subTitleSelected\u003dG1518949\u0026topicHRef\u003dG1448576\u0026div\u003df\u0026vFilteringEnabled\u003dTrue","contentHtml":""},{"id":103,"title":"Fuel Quality","body":"We recommend regular unleaded gasoline with a minimum pump (R+M)/2 octane rating of 87.

Brake assist can reduce stopping distances in critical situations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis system helps you maintain steering control during emergency stops by keeping the brakes from locking.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis feature is used to simulate the engine braking of an internal combustion engine and assist the standard brake system while recovering some of the energy of motion and storing it in the battery to improve fuel economy. The standard brake system is designed to fully stop the car if regenerative braking is not available. During regenerative braking, the motor is spun as a generator to create electrical current.

You decide to go golfing. Is there enough load capacity to carry you, four of your friends and all the golf bags? You and four friends average 220 pounds (99 kilograms) each and the golf bags weigh approximately 30 pounds (13.5 kilograms) each. The calculation would be: 1400 - (5 x 220) - (5 x 30) \u003d 1400 - 1100 - 150 \u003d 150 pounds. Yes, you have enough load capacity in your vehicle to transport four friends and your golf bags. In metric units, the calculation would be: 635 kilograms - (5 x 99 kilograms) - (5 x 13.5 kilograms) \u003d 635 - 495 - 67.5 \u003d 72.5 kilograms.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*Suppose your vehicle has a 1400-pound (635-kilogram) cargo and luggage capacity. You and one of your friends decide to pick up cement from the local home improvement store to finish that patio you have been planning for the past two years. Measuring the inside of the vehicle with the rear seat folded down, you have room for twelve 100-pound (45-kilogram) bags of cement. Do you have enough load capacity to transport the cement to your home? If you and your friend each weigh 220 pounds (99 kilograms), the calculation would be: 1400 - (2 x 220) - (12 x 100) \u003d 1400 - 440 - 1200 \u003d - 240 pounds. No, you do not have enough cargo capacity to carry that much weight. In metric units, the calculation would be: 635 kilograms - (2 x 99 kilograms) - (12 x 45 kilograms) \u003d 635 - 198 - 540 \u003d -103 kilograms. You will need to reduce the load weight by at least 240 pounds (104 kilograms). If you remove three 100-pound (45-kilogram) cement bags, then the load calculation would be: 1400 - (2 x 220) - (9 x 100) \u003d 1400 - 440 - 900 \u003d 60 pounds. Now you have the load capacity to transport the cement and your friend home.

For an 11500 pound (5216 kilogram) fifth wheel trailer, multiply by 0.15 and 0.25 to obtain a proper king pin load range of 1725 to 2875 pounds (782 to 1304 kilograms).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eSteps for determining the correct load limit:\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe following gives you a few examples on how to calculate the available amount of cargo and luggage load capacity:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e*Suppose your vehicle has a 1400-pound (635-kilogram) cargo and luggage capacity. You decide to go golfing. Is there enough load capacity to carry you, four of your friends and all the golf bags? You and four friends average 220 pounds (99 kilograms) each and the golf bags weigh approximately 30 pounds (13.5 kilograms) each. The calculation would be: 1400 - (5 x 220) - (5 x 30) \u003d 1400 - 1100 - 150 \u003d 150 pounds. Yes, you have enough load capacity in your vehicle to transport four friends and your golf bags. In metric units, the calculation would be: 635 kilograms - (5 x 99 kilograms) - (5 x 13.5 kilograms) \u003d 635 - 495 - 67.5 \u003d 72.5 kilograms.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e*Suppose your vehicle has a 1400-pound (635-kilogram) cargo and luggage capacity. You and one of your friends decide to pick up cement from the local home improvement store to finish that patio you have been planning for the past two years. Measuring the inside of the vehicle with the rear seat folded down, you have room for twelve 100-pound (45-kilogram) bags of cement. Do you have enough load capacity to transport the cement to your home? If you and your friend each weigh 220 pounds (99 kilograms), the calculation would be: 1400 - (2 x 220) - (12 x 100) \u003d 1400 - 440 - 1200 \u003d - 240 pounds. No, you do not have enough cargo capacity to carry that much weight. In metric units, the calculation would be: 635 kilograms - (2 x 99 kilograms) - (12 x 45 kilograms) \u003d 635 - 198 - 540 \u003d -103 kilograms. You will need to reduce the load weight by at least 240 pounds (104 kilograms). If you remove three 100-pound (45-kilogram) cement bags, then the load calculation would be: 1400 - (2 x 220) - (9 x 100) \u003d 1400 - 440 - 900 \u003d 60 pounds. Now you have the load capacity to transport the cement and your friend home. In metric units, the calculation would be: 635 kilograms - (2 x 99 kilograms) - (9 x 45 kilograms) \u003d 635 - 198 - 405 \u003d 32 kilograms.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe above calculations also assume that the loads are positioned in your vehicle in a manner that does not overload the Front or the Rear Gross Axle Weight Rating specified for your vehicle on the Safety Compliance Certification Label. The label shall be affixed to either the door hinge pillar, door-latch post, or the door edge that meets the door-latch post, next to the driver\u0027s seating position.\u003c/p\u003e"},{"id":136,"title":"Towing a Trailer","body":"","sourceUrl":"http://www.fordservicecontent.com/Ford_Content/vdirsnet/OwnerManual/Home/Content?bookCode\u003dO28450\u0026languageCode\u003den\u0026marketCode\u003dUS\u0026viewTech\u003dIE\u0026chapterTitleSelected\u003dG1518991\u0026subTitleSelected\u003dG1531310\u0026topicHRef\u003dG1531311\u0026div\u003df\u0026vFilteringEnabled\u003dTrue","contentHtml":""},{"id":137,"title":"Transporting the Vehicle","body":"If you need to have your vehicle towed, contact a professional towing service or, if you are a member of a roadside assistance program, your roadside assistance service provider.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe recommend the use of a wheel lift and dollies or flatbed equipment to tow your vehicle.

They do not apply to deep tread, winter-type snow tires, space-saver or temporary use spare tires, light truck or LT type tires, tires with nominal rim diameters of 10 to 12 inches or limited production tires as defined in Title 49 Code of Federal Regulations Part 575.104 (c)(2).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eU.S. Department of Transportation Tire quality grades: The U.S. Department of Transportation requires Ford Motor Company to give you the following information about tire grades exactly as the government has written it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe treadwear grade is a comparative rating based on the wear rate of the tire when tested under controlled conditions on a specified government test course. For example, a tire graded 150 would wear 1½ times as well on the government course as a tire graded 100. The relative performance of tires depends upon the actual conditions of their use, however, and may depart significantly from the norm due to variations in driving habits, service practices, and differences in road characteristics and climate.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe traction grades, from highest to lowest are AA, A, B, and C. The grades represent the tire’s ability to stop on wet pavement as measured under controlled conditions on specified government test surfaces of asphalt and concrete. A tire marked C may have poor traction performance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe temperature grades are A (the highest), B and C, representing the tire’s resistance to the generation of heat and its ability to dissipate heat when tested under controlled conditions on a specified indoor laboratory test wheel. Sustained high temperature can cause the material of the tire to degenerate and reduce tire life, and excessive temperature can lead to sudden tire failure. The grade C corresponds to a level of performance which all passenger car tires must meet under the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 139.

The cold inflation pressure should never be set lower than the recommended pressure on the Safety Compliance Certification Label or Tire Label.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen weather temperature changes occur, tire inflation pressures also change. A 10°F (6°C) temperature drop can cause a corresponding drop of 1 psi (7 kPa) in inflation pressure. Check your tire pressures frequently and adjust them to the proper pressure which can be found on the Safety Compliance Certification Label or Tire Label.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo check the pressure in your tire(s):\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePeriodically inspect the tire treads for uneven or excessive wear and remove objects such as stones, nails or glass that may be wedged in the tread grooves. Check the tire and valve stems for holes, cracks, or cuts that may permit air leakage and repair or replace the tire and replace the valve stem. Inspect the tire sidewalls for cracking, cuts, bruises and other signs of damage or excessive wear. If internal damage to the tire is suspected, have the tire demounted and inspected in case it needs to be repaired or replaced. For your safety, tires that are damaged or show signs of excessive wear should not be used because they are more likely to blow out or fail.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eImproper or inadequate vehicle maintenance can cause tires to wear abnormally. Inspect all your tires, including the spare, frequently, and replace them if one or more of the following conditions exist:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen the tread is worn down to one sixteenth of an inch (2 millimeters), tires must be replaced to help prevent your vehicle from skidding and hydroplaning. Built-in treadwear indicators, or wear bars, which look like narrow strips of smooth rubber across the tread will appear on the tire when the tread is worn down to one sixteenth of an inch (2 millimeters)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen the tire tread wears down to the same height as these wear bars, the tire is worn out and must be replaced.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePeriodically inspect the tire treads and sidewalls for damage (such as bulges in the tread or sidewalls, cracks in the tread groove and separation in the tread or sidewall). If damage is observed or suspected have the tire inspected by a tire professional. Tires can be damaged during off-road use, so inspection after off-road use is also recommended.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBoth United States and Canada Federal regulations require tire manufacturers to place standardized information on the sidewall of all tires.

For example, a tire graded 150 would wear 1½ times as well on the government course as a tire graded 100. The relative performance of tires depends upon the actual conditions of their use, however, and may depart significantly from the norm due to variations in driving habits, service practices, and differences in road characteristics and climate.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe traction grades, from highest to lowest are AA, A, B, and C.
