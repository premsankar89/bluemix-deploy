[{"id":1,"title":"3 Easy Ways to Hook Up a Battery Charger (with Pictures)","body":"Edit Article How to Hook Up a Battery Charger Three Parts:Preparing to Charge Your BatteryHooking Up the ChargerDisconnecting the ChargerQuestions and Answers An automobile’s battery provides the electricity necessary to start the car and to run its electrical equipment. Although an automobile battery is normally charged by the car’s alternator while the car is running, there are times when the battery dies for various reasons and needs to be connected to a charger. When jumpstarting a car you essentially give the dead battery just enough boost to start the engine and then rely on the alternator to charge the battery the rest of the way. When using a battery charger, you allow the battery to charge all the way before it will be used again. Ad Steps Part 1 Preparing to Charge Your Battery 1 Read the specifications for your battery. Start with the owner’s manual if your battery is original to the car. This should answer important questions such as what the voltage requirements are for charging your battery and whether or not you should remove it from the vehicle before charging.[1] Almost all car batteries are 12 volt, but the charging voltage can vary depending on the amount of charge your battery currently has and the temperature.[2] 2 Read the specifications for your battery charger. There will be a manual with your battery charger that provides details for the appropriate use of the charger. 3 Choose a well-ventilated work area. Working in a well-ventilated area will help dissipate the hydrogen gas that batteries generate from the sulfuric acid within their cells. Also, make sure to keep any other volatile substances, such as gasoline, flammable materials, or ignition sources (flames, cigarettes, matches, lighters) away from the battery at all times. 4 Put on protective gear. Glasses, gloves, and other protective gear is a good precaution. Hydrogen released within the battery quickly converts to a gas and expands, this can cause the battery to explode if venting mechanisms fail.[3] Once the hydrogen is in contact with the oxygen in the air, it is highly flammable and can be ignited even by static electricity.[4] 5 Turn off all vehicle accessories. These accessories draw power from the battery and should be turned off before removing or charging the battery. 6 Locate your battery. Most batteries will be found either under the hood of the vehicle or in the trunk. It is also possible that your battery may be under the rear seat, and sometimes the battery can only be accessed from underneath the side of the car. 7 Identify the positive and grounded posts on your battery. One post will be grounded by being connected to the vehicle’s chassis. The other post will be “hot,” meaning that current will flow from it to the grounded post in a circuit. There are a few ways to tell which is which: Look for labels such as “POS,” “P,” or “+” for the positive post and “NEG,” “N,” or “-“ for the negative (grounded) posts on the battery case. Compare the diameters of the battery posts. For most batteries, the positive post is thicker than the negative post. If the battery cables are connected to the posts, note the color of the cables. The cable connected to the positive post should be red, while the cable connected to the negative post should be black.[5] 8 Disconnect the vehicle battery cables. Disconnect the grounded terminal (negative), then the ungrounded terminal (positive) before removing the battery. 9 Remove the battery from the vehicle. Some vehicles require that you remove the battery before charging, others do not. Follow the instructions provided in your owner’s manual or with your battery. Typically if the battery you’re charging is for a boat, you must take the battery out of the boat and charge it on shore. You can charge the battery inside the boat only if you have a charger and other equipment that is specifically meant for doing so.[6] Using a battery carrier to move the battery from the vehicle to the place where you will connect it to the charger is recommended. This will avoid putting pressure on the battery ends and forcing battery acid out of the vent caps, as might happen if you carry it in your hands. Part 2 Hooking Up the Charger 1 Clean the battery terminals. Use a mixture of baking soda and water to clean any corrosion off the terminals and neutralize any sulfuric acid that may have spilled on them. You can apply the mixture with an old toothbrush. Alternatively, you can clean off mild corrosion by using a wire brush. Auto parts stores even sell a special round wire brush that fits over the terminals. Do not touch your eyes, nose, or mouth right after cleaning the terminals. Wash your hands immediately. Do not touch any white gunk that may appear on the terminals, as this is congealed sulfuric acid. 2 Pour in enough distilled water to reach the fill level on each battery cell. Pouring water into your battery cells disperses hydrogen gas from the cell. Do not use tap water as it will damage your battery over time.[7] Replace the cell caps after filling. Most U.S. batteries, they are equipped with flame arrestors. If your battery does not have flame-arresting caps, put a wet cloth across the top of the caps. If you have a battery that does not need filled with water (known as maintenance free batteries) or if your battery caps are sealed then you should ignore this step and follow the manufacturer’s instructions for charging your battery. 3 Place the charger as far from the battery as its cables will allow. This will reduce the possibility of damage to the unit from any airborne sulfuric acid vapor. Never place the charger directly above or below the battery.[8] 4 Set the charger to deliver the correct voltage. This is done by adjusting the voltage output selector, usually on the front of the charging unit. If the required voltage isn’t posted on the battery case itself, it should be in the vehicle owner’s manual. If your charger has an adjustable rate of charge you should start at the lowest rate. 5 Connect one charger clip to the positive post on the battery. This step is the same whether the battery is removed from the vehicle for charging or not. 6 Connect the second charger clip to ground. There are two different cases for connecting the ground. If the battery has not been removed from the vehicle, connect the battery charger’s grounding cable to a heavy-gauge metal part of the engine block or chassis. This prevents arcing at the battery terminal and will not run the risk of causing the battery to explode. Clipping the grounding cable directly to the negative battery terminal can be dangerous. If the battery has been removed from the vehicle, you should connect a jumper cable or insulated battery cable at least 24 inches (60 cm) long to the grounded post. Then, connect the battery charger clip for the grounded post to this cable. This allows you to be away from the battery when you complete the circuit in case it explodes. It is also a good idea not to be facing the battery when you connect the charger to the jumper cable. 7 Plug the charger into an outlet. The charger should be equipped with a grounded plug (three pronged plug) and should be plugged into a properly grounded outlet (three prong outlet). An adapter should not be used. Use an extension cord only if absolutely necessary. If an extension cord is necessary, it should be a grounded (three pronged) extension cord and be the proper wire size to accommodate the amperage of the charger. An adapter should not be used between the charger and extension cord or the extension cord and the wall. 8 Leave the battery on the charger until the battery is fully charged. You can tell this by using the recommended charging time for your battery or looking to see if the charge indicator shows the battery has been fully charged. Part 3 Disconnecting the Charger 1 Unplug the charger. Once your battery is fully charged, you will need to systematically unhook your components. Start by unplugging the charger from the outlet. 2 Disconnect the charger grounding clip from the battery. Disconnect from the grounded terminal first. Again, this will be the negative terminal on the battery if the battery was removed and will be the clip attached to a metal component of the vehicle if the battery was not removed. 3 Disconnect the positive clip from the battery. This will be the clip on the positive battery post. Some battery chargers have an engine starting feature. If your battery charger has one, you can leave it connected to the battery when you start the vehicle’s engine; if not, you must disconnect the charger before you start the engine. In either case, avoid moving engine parts if you start the engine with the hood raised or cover removed. 4 Re-install the battery. This will only be necessary if you had to remove your battery for charging. 5 Reconnect the battery cables. Connect to the ungrounded (positive) terminal first, then to the grounded (negative) terminal.

When connecting the charger clips to the battery, rock or twist them several times to make sure they are well-connected. Even when wearing safety glasses, turn away from the battery when making final connections to the charger. Your battery may also have indicator eyes. These do not indicate the condition of the battery, only the present charge of the battery. Indicator eyes are also less accurate once the vehicle has been driven. They are primarily used during manufacturing and to provide the dealership information about the charge of the car prior to selling it.[9] Warnings Take off any rings, bracelets, wristwatches, necklaces, or other personal metal jewelry before you work with a battery and battery charger. Any of these could cause a shot circuit, melting the item and burning you severely. Although higher levels of current will charge the battery faster, too high a rate of current will overheat the battery and damage it. Never exceed the recommended rate of charging, and if the battery gets hot to the touch, stop charging and let it cool before continuing to recharge it.[10] Never allow a metal tool to touch both battery posts simultaneously. Have plenty of soap and fresh water on hand to wash away any leaking battery acid. Wash away immediately any acid that contacts skin or clothing. If you should get battery acid in your eyes, flush them with cold water for at least 15 minutes and seek medical help at once.

The value of a salvaged car relies heavily on the amount of damage it has sustained, and also on the exact mathematical formula used by the insurance company. First, you must determine the current retail and trade-in values for the car based on its year, make, and model, which are used to calculate the car\u0027s market value. You must then contact your insurance company to obtain the percentage rate they use against the market value in determining the final salvage value. Continue reading this article to learn of the steps you must take to determine the approximate value of a salvaged car. Ad Steps Method 1 Determining Retail and Trade-In Values 1 Use blue book tools to evaluate the car\u0027s values. Both the retail value and trade-in value (also known as wholesale value) for your car will be found in a blue book. Consult with the Kelley Blue Book, NADA Guide, or Edmunds websites to determine both the retail and trade-in values of your car. Method 2 Calculating the Current Market Value 1 Use the retail and trade-in values to determine the car\u0027s market value. The market value will be an average of the retail and trade-in values. Add the retail and trade-in values, then divide the sum by 2 to obtain the current market value. For example, if a car has a retail value of 7,000 dollars (5,502 euros), and a trade-in value of 5,000 dollars (3,930 euros), the sum is 12,000 dollars (9,432 euros). 12,000 divided by 2 is 6,000, so the market value of the car will be 6,000 dollars (4,716 euros). Method 3 Determining the Salvage Value 1 Contact your insurance company to obtain the percentage used for the salvage value calculation. Every insurance company uses a different percentage based on their policies and procedures in assessing the damage of the salvaged car. In most cases, the percentage used by insurance companies is between 75 and 80 percent. 2 Calculate the value of the salvaged vehicle. The salvage value calculation will require you to use the market value and the percentage given to you by your insurance company. Multiply the market value by the percentage provided to you by the insurance company. For example, if the market value of your car is 6,000 dollars (4,716 euros), and the insurance company calculates the salvaged value using 80 percent, the salvaged value of the car is 4,800 dollars (3,772 euros). Reader Questions and Answers Unanswered Questions Show more unanswered questions Add New Question Answered Questions Why is my insurance company charging me a salvage fee if I decide to keep my totaled car? It\u0027s still my car, and they don\u0027t have to salvage it, I\u0027m keeping it. So why the fee? Its not a salvage fee as much as it is a salvage value. They are paying you the value of the car before the accident and in essence buying the car off you in the process. If they keep the car they will sell it as salvage to cover some of their losses. If you keep the salvage, they would be paying you for the vehicle and then you would still have the value of the salvage on top, so you would be making a profit. The insurance is only designed to get you back into the position you were before the loss, not to allow you to profit. So if your car is worth £1000 but you could sell the salvage for £200.00, they would pay you £800. This way you\u0027ve overall got the amount you were due. Helpful?

Video Tips Have your car appraised by an automobile appraiser or by a junk yard to gain their opinions of how much your salvaged car is worth. An average of their quote and the true salvage value can help you set a sale price for your salvaged car if you plan on selling it. You can also determine the approximate salvaged value of a car by multiplying the retail value by between 40 and 50 percent; however, the most accurate salvage value will be provided by the insurance company and can vary based on the amount of damage on the car.

Diagnosing the reason that your air conditioning isn’t working will help you determine whether the problem is one that you can fix yourself or if you need to take it to a repair shop. You are also less likely to be taken advantage of at a repair shop if you already know why your AC is not working. Ad Steps Method 1 Collecting Initial Information 1 Turn the air conditioning on while the car is running. The air conditioner won’t run properly unless your engine is running. The best setting for diagnosis is “fresh air” (not recirculated) with the air blowing out of the center vents in the dash and the AC turned on. Start with the fan speed turned to its highest setting. If your car has a “Max AC” setting, select that option. 2 Listen for unusual noises coming from the AC. Noise could indicate that there is a problem with your compressor and that it needs repair or replacing. 3 Feel the air coming out of the vents. You will need to know if the air is cold, room temperature, or hotter than the air around it. Also note if it starts cold but turns warmer, or if it is usually warm but blows cold intermittently. 4 Notice the air pressure. Turn the air pressure to the high and low settings and see if the airflow changes like it normally does. 5 Smell the air coming from the vents. If there are unusual smells, you could have a leak. You may also need to change your cabin air filter.[1] 6 Inspect your car’s fuses. Check your owner’s manual for the location of your car’s fuse panel, as it may be under the hood, in the trunk, or even in the driver’s foot well area. A blown fuse can cause your AC to stop working. Method 2 Diagnosing Airflow Problems 1 Check all of the vents. Be sure that air pressure is coming out of the vents that you have selected. Move the vent selector to see if the air moves to the proper vents. If changing the selected vent does not alter the flow of air, you likely have a blend door problem, which will require replacing the doors inside the dash that determine the direction of the air flow.[2][3] Blend doors change position when the temperature selection is changed, blocking the flow or permitting the flow of either hot or cold air. Sometimes an AC system with a mode door problem could be working fine, but the air flow is being directed somewhere else, like back out to the engine, instead of into the car. 2 Look at your cabin air filter. Especially if the air coming from your vents smells funny or if you think you have had a slow decrease in pressure for some time, check the air filter. You will be able to see if it has a buildup of dirt or debris on it.[4] It is possible that your cabin air filter is so blocked that it is interfering with your air pressure, and replacing it will be a relatively easy an inexpensive fix to your problem. Your car manual may have instructions on replacing the cabin filter. If it doesn’t, try searching online for “replace cabin air filter” followed by the year, make, and model of your car (for example, you might search for “replace cabin air filter for 2006 Toyota Camry”). 3 Check for a blower motor problem. The easiest way to do this is to try turning on your heat. If you have weak air flow when the heat is on as well, your blower motor may have gone out.[5] A blower motor may have a resistor problem if your air only blows on the high setting but will not blow on a lower setting.[6] Unfortunately, mice and other rodents sometimes build homes in car HVAC hoses and can get caught in the blower motor when the car is started. A loud noise (or bad smell) coming when the heat or air are running could be a sign of this problem.[7] Method 3 Diagnosing Air Temperature Problems 1 Find the front of your AC condenser. It is normally located in front of your radiator. If there are leaves or other dirt or buildup blocking it, remove them and clean the area.[8] 2 Look under the hood at the AC compressor clutch. If your air pressure is normal but the air is hot, you may have a compressor problem. Checking to see if the compressor clutch is engaging is a simple visual inspection. The compressor is usually located towards the front of your engine, just inside the grill of your car. Your car should be running with the AC on to check the compressor clutch. The compressor looks like a small motor with a large wheel on the end. The wheel (which is the compressor clutch) should be spinning. If it is not spinning, you have a problem with your compressor.[9] 3 Check the tension on the belt of the compressor. It should be tight. If it is loose, you need a new compressor belt.[10] 4 Find any coolant system leaks. One of the most common AC temperature problems is low refrigerant. The AC system is closed, so refrigerant should not be lost unless there is a leak.[11] Look for oily residue on or around hoses that attach AC components together. Oily spots may indicate a refrigerant leak. You may consider using an electronic leak detector, which can detect much smaller quantities of refrigerant. There are also some testers that use dye, UV light, and protective glasses to find leaks. If you do find a leak, you will likely need to hire a professional to repair the leak. You will probably need new parts too, as many of the components cannot be repaired or patched. 5 Check for freezing. If your AC blows cold initially but then stops being cold after some use, it could be freezing. Excess air and moisture in the system may lead components to freeze (literally).[12] Freezing can also be caused by an oversaturated receiver/drier or accumulator. Turning the system off for a while and letting it thaw will temporarily solve the problem. If the problem is persistent, you may need your system to be flushed or evacuated with a vacuum pump.

It is always best to consult a professional to do repairs to your vehicle. Wear safety glasses and work in an open environment, where fumes won’t overwhelm you. Never touch your eyes or mouth after handling Freon or other chemicals. Wear long sleeves and gloves whenever possible.[13] Related wikiHows How to Keep Car Doors from Freezing Shut How to Extend the Life of Your Car How to Recharge the Air Conditioner in a Car How to Fix Your Car\u0027s Air Conditioner Sources and Citations Show Sources and Citations (13) ? http://www.agcoauto.com/content/news/p2_articleid/256 ? http://www.motor.com/article.asp?article_ID\u003d1874 ? http://www.firestonecompleteautocare.com/cf/maintenance/car-air-conditioning-repair-troubleshooting/ ? http://www.carcare.org/2013/10/time-to-change-your-vehicles-cabin-air-filter/ ? http://www.youfixcars.com/blower-motor.html ? http://www.ericthecarguy.com/faq/solving-automotive-hvac-problems?start\u003d7 ? http://www.ericthecarguy.com/faq/solving-automotive-hvac-problems?start\u003d7 ? http://www.ericthecarguy.com/faq/solving-automotive-hvac-problems?start\u003d2#FindingOutWhatsWrongWithYourAC ? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u003dPMM80xlon3U ? http://www.ericthecarguy.com/faq/solving-automotive-hvac-problems?start\u003d2#FindingOutWhatsWrongWithYourAC ? http://www.agcoauto.com/content/news/p2_articleid/258 ? http://www.aa1car.com/library/ac98.htm ? http://www.youfixcars.com/automotive-air-conditioning-safety.html","sourceUrl":"cars\\3 Ways to Diagnose a Non Working Air Conditioning in a Car.html"},{"id":4,"title":"3 Ways to Diagnose Car Smells - wikiHow","body":"Edit Article How to Diagnose Car Smells Three Methods:Diagnosing Exhaust, Sulfur, and Gas SmellsDiagnosing Burning SmellsMaking Your Car Smell BetterQuestions and Answers If you\u0027re smelling something unusual in your car, this can be the sign of a serious mechanical problem. It also might just mean that you spilled food in your car and have a mildew problem, though. Either way, it\u0027s important you diagnose and eliminate any car smells. Some of them can be very dangerous. Ad Steps Method 1 Diagnosing Exhaust, Sulfur, and Gas Smells 1 Determine whether you have a leak in your exhaust system. Smelling exhaust in a car is an incredibly dangerous situation because carbon monoxide is toxic for human beings. So if you smell exhaust within your car, get the car checked out by a professional immediately. There could be a hole in anything from the muffler to the tailpipe of your car. It’s also possible that exhaust is leaking into the car through a part of the interior that is worn. Don’t play around with this scenario. It’s extremely dangerous. 2 Replace your catalytic converter. If you smell a sulfur or rotten eggs smell, you’re probably going to need to get your car serviced by a professional.[1] Usually, the smell of sulfur indicates there is a problem with your catalytic converter. The converter will probably need to be replaced. The way this is done is to cut the converter on both ends after the engine cools. Then, replace it with a new converter. 3 Replace your fuel filter. It’s also possible that the converter is just plugged up, but most likely you are going to have to replace it. Other causes of rotten eggs smells can include hot engines or broken fuel pressure regulators. All you might need to do for the latter is replace your fuel filter. A rotten eggs smell is probably the result of hydrogen sulfide. Sulfur is present in gasoline, and it’s converted to sulfur dioxide, which is odorless. However, when your converter breaks down or its filtering layers are worn out, sulfur produces a strong smell of rotten eggs.[2] 4 Determine whether you\u0027ve flooded the car. Gasoline smell signals a problem with the car. However, it might be easy to fix if the car is just flooded. If the car isn’t starting, flooding is a distinct possibility. Just wait a few minutes, and try to start the car again. If the gas smell seems to be emanating from underneath your hood, your fuel injection system or carburetor might be leaking fuel. You can also check your fuel pump for a streak of leaking gasoline, which should be clearly visible. 5 Check fuel lines and hoses. You will also want to check the fuel lines and hoses inside your hood that lead to the fuel tank. It’s possible they’re disconnected or rotted. You might want to check under the hood again after parking the car overnight. You will want to look for stains because gasoline evaporates pretty quickly. Make sure not to smoke cigarettes while looking for gasoline leaks. This can be very dangerous. It’s also possible that you spilled some gasoline while pumping it into your car. Maybe the gasoline you smell is that which dropped onto your hands! Method 2 Diagnosing Burning Smells 1 Lighten up on the clutch and brakes. If you smell burning toast while you’re working the gears of the car, this is probably an issue with your clutch. But it could also be your break pads. You could be riding the clutch pedal too hard, which creates friction between the clutch facing and the clutch slips. If you lighten up on it, the smell should disappear. The material is made of paper, which is why the smell has the faint odor of burning paper. If you’re pressing your brakes too hard, you might be overheating your brake pads. This can also cause a burning smell. It could help to downshift. You also could have a dragging brake because a brake caliper piston might have seized. Another possibility is to make sure you didn’t leave your handbrake on while driving. One way to check the brake pads is to see if any of your wheels feels hot. If none of them does, then maybe it\u0027s the overheated clutch instead of a dragging brake shoe. 2 Check to see if your engine is overheating. Figure out why you smell oil burning. Burning oil has an odor that is thick and acrid. When you smell it, you need to determine right away whether you are running out of oil. Another possibility is that your engine is overheating. If neither one of these things seems to be the answer, check to see if there is oil leaking onto your engine block. You may need an oil change if you are smelling burning oil.[3] You could also check your transmission fluid using a dipstick. Maybe your transmission fluid is low. This can cause it to burn in the transmission because the gears get too hot because they are not properly lubricated. 3 Check for a loose hose. If the smell is closer to rubber burning than oil burning, check to see if a hose came loose under your hood. It’s possible that it’s touching a part of the hot engine. Sometimes an oil smell is from a leaking crankshaft seal. If that’s the case, you’ll also find oil on the pavement beneath the car most likely.[4] 4 Check to see if your coolant is leaking if you smell maple syrup. If the car smells like maple syrup after you’ve warmed up the engine (or even after you’ve shut it off a few minutes later), you should take immediate action. This smell might mean that your coolant is leaking from somewhere like a radiator or heater hose. This kind of a problem means it\u0027s a good idea to take your car into a professional. If you smell maple syrup outside the car, this might mean that you have a leaking radiator cap or that the radiator itself has a leak. If you smell it inside your car instead, this might mean that your heater core has gone bad.[5] Method 3 Making Your Car Smell Better 1 Get rid of other common smells in your car. If your car smells are unpleasant but aren’t a sign of mechanical malfunction, there are ways you can make your car smell better. Try baking soda. This will remove odors from carpet. Maybe some food spilled on the carpet. Remove what you can, and then sprinkle baking soda on it. Rub it in. Leave it for a couple of hours, and then vacuum it up.[6] Charcoal also absorbs smells. If you leave a chunk of grilling charcoal in the car for a couple of days, the charcoal will absorb a lot of the car smell. You could also put vanilla or another scent on cotton balls, and leave them in your car. Or you could put a container of ground coffee in the car. To deal with the smell of cigarettes, open your hood and spray air deodorizer in the intake valve. This is necessary because cigarette smoke also enters your car’s duct system. 2 Protect your car from growing smells. Use a little preventative maintenance so that bad smells don’t take over your car. This can be as simple as vacuuming your car regularly to remove dirt that’s been tracked in it or food crumbs that have spilled.[7] Don’t let trash accumulate in your car. Keep a small plastic bag in the car to immediately deposit trash inside, and throw it away every few days (or even every day). 3 Shampoo your car regularly. If you\u0027ve got a problem with food or drink spills, it\u0027s a good idea to shampoo your car\u0027s floor mats or seats. Remove floor mats, and shampoo them immediately if food spills on them. Just take detergent and water, and scrub them. You can also buy car upholstery shampoos in many auto stores. It\u0027s a good idea to test the detergent on a small spot first. You can also use carpet cleaner, and a wet/dry shop vac. Just spray the carpet cleaner on the seats. Vacuum it up.[8] 4 Diagnose the odor as mildew. One of the most common odors in a car is mustiness. It can smell like old gym socks. Just hanging up an air freshener won\u0027t permanently eliminate the problem.[9] If you smell this odor, especially when you turn on your heater or your air conditioner, it’s probably mildew that grew because moisture condensed inside your air conditioner. The key is to dry out the air conditioning system. You can do this by turning off your air conditioner and running the fan on high for about a mile. 5 Remove other causes of car mildew. You’re not going to be able to camouflage this one with a bunch of air fresheners. You’ll have to get at the root of the problem, which is likely moisture or humidity inside the car.[10] Look for condensation inside the car. Remove the floor mats to see if they appear wet. Look in the trunk and in the spare tire storage space. It’s also possible that the air conditioning filter is causing the musty smell. See if the floor mat is wet near the air conditioner. If you smell the odor from the floor or trunk, remove all floor mats. If the smell is coming from the air conditioner, remove the filter in it. Just open up the front cover of the unit to remove the filter. 6 Get rid of the moisture that\u0027s causing the mildew. Take a rag, and wipe off any moisture that you can find. If you see any mildew or mold on the area, use a nylon scrub pad to remove it. Try not to scratch the car. Now you will need to dry the area to remove the moisture causing the smell. You can use a hair dryer if the area is small enough or a wet vacuum for larger areas. You could use a cotton swab in the air conditioner. You might want to apply anti-mildew solution to the area. Dry any of the floor mats you removed, and then put baking soda on them. Let them hang outside for 24 hours, vacuum, and put back in the car.[11] Reader Questions and Answers Unanswered Questions What should I do if I have a very bad carbon monoxide smell in inside the car?

Cars and motorcycles list the VIN in different places, so where you look will depend on the type of vehicle you have. The engine number is the number that is stamped on your vehicle’s engine. If you are having trouble finding the VIN or engine number on your vehicle, there are several places that you can check. Ad Steps Method 1 Finding the VIN on a Car 1 Check your paperwork. If you do not have access to your vehicle or if you do not want to go looking around the vehicle for the VIN, there are several different pieces of paperwork that should include the VIN. Some of the documents that you can check include:[1] title registration card owner’s manual insurance documents body shop repair records police reports vehicle history reports 2 Look at your dashboard. The easiest place to find the VIN on your vehicle is right on the lower left corner of your dashboard. You should be able to read the number by looking through your windshield on the driver’s side of your car.[2] 3 Check the driver’s side door. The VIN might also be located in the driver’s side doorjamb or on the doorpost. Open your driver’s side door and look around the edges of the doorjamb for a little white sticker.[3] If your VIN is on the doorjamb, then it should be on the area of the doorjamb just below the level of the rearview mirror. The VIN number may also be on the opposite side of the driver’s side doorjamb, near where the driver’s side seatbelt latches.[4] 4 Pop the hood. If you haven’t found it anywhere else, then you can pop your hood and look at the front of the engine block. The VIN number may be written on the front of the engine block.[5] 5 Inspect the frame. Sometimes the VIN is written on the front of the vehicle’s frame, somewhere near the windshield washer fluid container. Go to the front of the car, pop your hood, locate your window washer fluid container, close the hood, and then inspect the vehicle’s frame near this area of your vehicle for the VIN.[6] 6 Lift up your spare tire. If you have a spare tire in the back of your trunk and you haven’t found the VIN anywhere else, it might be back there. Pop your trunk, remove the spare tire, and look in the space where the spare is usually kept. The VIN may be written in this area.[7] 7 Peek under the wheel well. Another place you can check is under your rear wheel well. Go to the back of your vehicle, get down on the ground, and look up at your wheel well. Check both sides to see if the VIN is recorded here.[8] You will probably need a flashlight to see the VIN if it is written here. 8 Write it down somewhere! After you have found your VIN, make sure that you write it down and keep it in a file for easy access the next time that you need it. Keep the VIN number in a physical file, save it to a file on your computer, or email it to yourself. 9 Identify the chassis number. Remember that the chassis number is made up of the last six digits of the VIN.[9] Look at the VIN that you have written down and circle the last six digits of the number to identify your vehicle’s chassis number. Method 2 Finding the VIN on a Motorcycle, Scooter, or ATV 1 Look for the VIN at the steering neck. The steering neck is the most common place to find a VIN on a motorcycle. You can locate the VIN by turning the handles to one side and looking at the steering neck, which is a metal cylinder that runs down from the handles. The VIN should be etched into the metal.[10] You may have to check both sides of the steering neck to find the VIN. 2 Check the motor. Sometimes the VIN is located on the motor for motorcycles. If you could not find the VIN on the steering neck, then check the motor. The VIN should be near the bottom of the motor’s cylinders.[11] 3 Inspect the front frame. For ATVs and some motorcycles, the VIN may be on the frame, but it is not always easy to find. You may need to look around a bit and use a flashlight to locate a VIN that is printed on the inner frame of a bike. Check the outside of the frame first. The VIN may be located just below your bike’s shifter on the left side of your bike. If you can’t find it on the outside of the bike, start looking on the inside of the frame.[12] Some manufacturers stamp the VIN on specific areas of the frame. For example, Honda stamps the VIN on the right side of the steering head as well as on the area of the frame just above the motor on the left side of the bike.[13] Check with your manufacturer to see if there are specific areas where you should look first. 4 Remember to circle the last six digits. The last six digits of your motorcycle’s VIN number make up your motorcycle’s chassis number. Circle the last six digits to identify the chassis number. Method 3 Finding the Engine Number 1 Check the engine. Your vehicle’s engine number should be stamped right onto the engine of your vehicle.[14] Pop the hood of your vehicle or look at your motorcycle’s engine from the side. You should see a sticker that clearly indicates the engine number. 2 Look at your owner’s manual. If you cannot find a sticker on your engine that lists your engine number, then check your owner’s manual for this information. It should be located within the first few pages of the booklet.[15] Your owner’s manual may also include a picture of where to find the engine number on the engine block.[16] 3 Identify the engine number. The engine number is a six digit number that follows a three digit engine code. You may notice that the engine number includes three digits followed by six more digits. The first three digits are your vehicle’s engine code and the last six digits are your vehicle’s engine number.[17] Reader Questions and Answers Unanswered Questions Where is the Toyota Etios Chassis number?

Mandatory testing can be a frightening prospect for those of us who drive regularly. But learning the emissions standards in your area, how to schedule an inspection, and how to give yourself the best possibility of passing the test can take a lot of the stress out of the equation. If you have a vehicle of your own, see Step 1 to learn more about passing an emissions test. Ad Steps Method 1 Learning the Emissions Standards 1 Check the emissions standards and procedures in your state. Many states require periodic emissions tests to be performed to ensure that your car is running as clean as possible and not contributing to excessive air pollution. There are a lot of complicated numbers associated with the process that are probably not of interest to the average driver and vehicle owner, but you can research the Environmental Protection Agency standards for all vehicles here. You don\u0027t need to know the standards to have your vehicle tested. All you need to do is find a testing location in your area and schedule an appointment. They\u0027ll tell you if your vehicle is up to the standards, and help you get it to code if it isn\u0027t. You can help avoid problems by keeping up on the maintenance of your engine fluids and filters. You should have your exhaust system checked periodically for any issues that may cause a future failure. If your check engine light comes on, have it serviced quickly to prevent further problems. 2 Find your particular vehicle group. Emissions testing is different for different types of vehicles, and is required for a vehicle to be street-legal in some states, while in others there\u0027s no requirement at all. Motorcycles are required to be tested in some areas, but not in others. Check with your local bureau of motor vehicles to make sure your vehicle needs to be tested. The most common exclusions are: Vehicles manufactured pre-1975 Diesel vehicles manufactured pre-1997 Electric vehicles and hybrids Trailers[1] 3 Learn the common causes of emission issues. Failing the emission test is likely the result of some common performance issues in your vehicle. Learning to anticipate and correct these issues can help you pass the emissions test, once you\u0027ve got it scheduled. The most common system failures are: Out-of-spec fuel metering: This could be the result of the CPU, if your vehicle has one, or the fuel injection and carburetor unit. Worn-out spark plugs: These can cause hydrocarbons to spike during the examination. Just basic maintenance on the engine can sometimes cause emissions to spike. Vacuum leaks: These can occur because the MAP sensor is dysfunctional, or the hoses are faulty. Your MAF sensor may also have issues with a vacuum leak and turn on the check engine light. Air-injection and EVAP malfunction: If the air-injection system in the engine malfunctions, it won\u0027t be able to control the hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions properly.[2] The EVAP system may be venting fuel vapors into the engine when it is not supposed to, causing high hydrocarbons. Method 2 Getting an Inspection 1 Schedule a vehicle inspection. Get your car checked out by an emissions technician in your area to catch anything that you might have missed or overlooked. Typically, in states that require vehicles be emission-tested, these are as common as oil-change stations and Jiffy-Lubes. Look one up in your area and schedule a test. Just because your car is running fine and shows no signs of \"problems\" doesn\u0027t mean that it\u0027ll pass emissions. Many vehicles can continue operating well even though they\u0027ve dipped under the local government regulations. This can happen when you don\u0027t keep up with scheduled maintenance. 2 Make sure the check engine light is off before your appointment. If your check engine light is on, you will fail the emissions test automatically. If you don\u0027t know what the problem is, an emissions repair shop can run a diagnostics test and fix the problem for you. The car must be tested as-is, which means that even if the technician spots an issue that will obviously result in a failure of the test, the vehicle must be failed. If you know, for example, that you\u0027ve got a leaky vacuum hose, or that your check engine light is on, you need to have those issues corrected at the shop or fix them yourself, before having the test performed. 3 Warm up your vehicle before testing. Drive your vehicle for at least 20 minutes before arriving at the emissions testing station. This will give your vehicle enough time to reach optimal temperatures for your coolant and oils as well as optimal temperature for your catalytic converter, ensuring that you\u0027ll get an accurate reading. If you cannot drive your vehicle before the test then just run your engine in park or neutral at 1500 to 2000 RPM’s for at least five minutes to ensure your engine and exhaust are warmed up. In colder weather this may take a few minutes longer. 4 Keep your tires inflated properly. Proper tire pressure will put less strain on your car engine, which will improve your chances of passing the test. Equally-distributing the weight of the vehicle as it is driven during the test by the inspector will result in a higher likelihood that you\u0027ll pass. It\u0027s a good idea to fill up the tires to the proper specs before you take it in. 5 Pick a dry day for the test. Because a dynamometer will be involved in the test, driving on slippery roads in which you might lose some traction can affect the efficiency of your engine, possibly enough to skew the test. To give yourself the best possibility of passing with flying colors, schedule the test for a sunny day with nice weather and good driving conditions.[3] Method 3 Maintaining Your Vehicle 1 Change your engine oil regularly. If you haven\u0027t changed your oil in over 5,000 miles (8,000 km), this is almost a necessity. If you have changed your oil in the past 5,000 miles (8,000 km), it may still be a good idea to get it changed again before having your car tested. Schedule an oil change, or do it yourself. Dirty oils can cause the emission levels to be higher than normal. 2 Replace your filters regularly. Fuel and air filters need to be changed periodically to keep your engine as efficient as possible, and your emissions as low-impact as possible. Consult your owner\u0027s manual for specific guidelines regarding mileage, and keep a steady schedule of replacements. Check your air filter and, if it is dirty, change it before your emission test, since a dirty air filter can cause high hydrocarbons. 3 Use fuel additives if they\u0027re appropriate for your vehicle. Check your owner\u0027s manual to determine whether or not using Premium fuel is appropriate for your model. Other additives, like Clean Sky Clean Air can be added during refueling to purge carbon deposits from the engine during normal operations. Be aware that some additives could alter your emissions test and could be a cause of a failure. Be sure to tell your mechanic what additives you are using if you have failed. The additive could have been the cause. 4 Adjust your carburetor for the proper air-fuel mixture. Running too rich can have a long-term affect on your engine\u0027s ability to process hydrocarbons and CO emissions. It\u0027s a good idea to periodically check how lean or rich your engine is running to make sure you\u0027re within the proper specifications and keep your engine functioning properly.[4] Reader Questions and Answers Unanswered Questions I have lost a section of exhaust pipe from rust.

Humidity and rain can affect the temperatures of your vehicle, causing it to run sub-optimally. It\u0027s possible to pass the test on a rainy day, but it will just be more difficult. Do not schedule an emissions test if your car is not functioning or driving properly. Cars that don\u0027t show any outward problems can still fail the emissions test so it\u0027s almost impossible for your car to pass the test if it has noticeable problems. Scheduled maintenance is a guideline and servicing may need to be done more often than the recommended service intervals. Even if you State does not require a vehicle inspection keeping up on repairs and maintenance will benefit for a better running vehicle that gets better fuel mileage with less breakdowns. Use additives in your fuel to help reduce emission levels. Additives are typically poured into the gas tank while refueling at a station. They help to clean out your vehicle\u0027s internal system, allowing for more efficient usage of fuel and improving overall engine performance.

It does happen all too often, and sometimes happens right in the ignition lock of your car! Luckily, you can usually get the broken pieces out without calling a locksmith. Ad Steps Method 1 Removing the Key with Metal Wire 1 Clear away any obstructions in the ignition lock. Remove any debris from that might be blocking the key fragment with compressed air. Do not spray cleaners or lubricants into the ignition lock as these chemicals may damage the lock. This is especially true for newer vehicles with added features.[1] 2 Place the place entire key back into the lock. This will serve as a guide to help you reach the broken piece of the key. 3 Slide a thin, stiff wire along the sides the broken key. Paperclips make a good wire. You can straighten them out so that they will slide alongside the key into the lock. Sometimes it is best to bend the ends just slightly to help with grasping the key fragment. 4 Remove the head of the broken key from the ignition switch. Be careful not to pull your wire out with the key handle. You want to keep it in place on the broken piece of key still in your ignition. 5 Grip the broken piece of key between the wires. It may help to twist the wires around each other to secure a good grip. You may also be able to use them in a similar fashion to chopsticks or tweezers. You can also try bending the ends downward so that the wire has more surface area in contact with the key fragment. This may help you grasp the fragment and pull it out. 6 Pull the broken piece out. While you are pulling out, shaking up and down slightly may reduce the risk of getting the broken piece lodged. Method 2 Opening the Key Hole 1 Use long, thin needle nose pliers to spread the key opening. Insert the tip of the pliers into the keyhole and then open them to spread the keyhole opening. There is no need to do this unless the broken piece of key is stuck, as it can damage your ignition lock/keyhole. Opening the keyhole will provide a clear path for removing the piece. 2 Grab the broken piece of key with the pliers. Once you have opened the keyhole, slide the pliers as far as you can into the lock and attempt to grasp the key fragment with them. If the pliers will not fit far enough into the opening to grasp they key then you can attempt to use wire or tweezers. 3 Pull the broken piece of key out of the opening.

Several methods exist for repairing minor dents. Ad Steps Method 1 1 Rub a small amount of petroleum jelly around the lip of a household plunger to get a good seal on the surface of the car. 2 Position the plunger directly over the small dent on the body of the car. 3 Push the plunger in toward the body of the car, carefully and slowly. 4 Pull the plunger out toward you quickly. The dent should suck out as you pull the plunger out. Method 2 1 Drill a small hole in the center of the dent using a drill. Use the drill bit recommended by your drill\u0027s specifications. Always drill from the outside in. 2 Insert the dent-pulling plunger tool through the hole you drilled. 3 Pull evenly and firmly on the dent-pulling tool. 4 Crawl under the bottom of the car, taking a metal working hammer with you. 5 Hammer, using light strokes, to remove the remainder of the dent. Stop hammering to check the appearance of the dent. If it is still visible, return under your car and continue hammering the back of the dent until the surface has become smooth. If you do not have a metal working hammer, a rubber mallet or a household hammer, covered with an old cloth, will also work. 6 Apply body filler in small amounts to fill in the hole you drilled earlier. 7 Smooth the body filler with a putty knife. 8 Wet a piece of 1500 grit sandpaper and smooth and blend the surface. 9 Cover the body filler with touch-up paint that is the same shade as the color of your car. 10 Smooth the touch-up paint on your car, using wet 2000 grit sandpaper.

They’re your ticket to mobility and if they aren’t around, you’re stuck. Luckily if you find yourself in a bind there are plenty of ways to replace a misplaced or malfunctioning car key. Unfortunately, replacing car keys can also be really expensive in some cases – but not all! Ad Steps Method 1 Replacing an Older Car Key 1 Write down you car\u0027s VIN number. This will be necessary in finding someone who will help you replace the key. In most cars, the VIN is located on the driver’s side dashboard and is visible through the window, but it may also be located on a rear wheel well or the front of the engine block, in the trunk or door jam, or on the frame of the car between the carburetor and windshield washer.[1] If you’re not sure where your VIN is on your vehicle you can also look up the number on your car insurance information. It should be in the top left hand corner of each page. 2 Write down the year, make, and model of your vehicle. Regardless of which option you pursue to get a new set of car keys you\u0027re going to need to find out this information. This information will let you know the specific kind of key that you need to open your vehicle. Remember, keys are supposed to be unique! 3 Call a nearby auto locksmith. This should be your first option. They generally they will give you the best deal on a new key, about half as much as it would cost to get a new key from your manufacturer or dealer. Normally they don’t charge to visit the car either. They’ll open your car and then proceed to make you a new key. While hardware stores aren’t generally equipped to create new car keys (as opposed to simply copying them), locksmiths usually have more sophisticated machinery. The older your vehicle, the better the odds that a locksmith will be able to help you with a replacement key. [2] If you lost a key fob, a good locksmith may be able to help you make a new one – depending on how sophisticated the key was. Additionally, they should be able to help you reprogram the replacement key, though your manual should also have instructions on how to do that. Be sure to bring any other key fobs associated with that vehicle with you, as they sometimes won’t work until the new key is programmed. [3] 4 Look for discounted replacement keys / key fobs online. After market keys or even factory replacements can sometimes be found online for less than it would cost you to get them direct from the manufacturer. You may have success with a reputable dealer on eBay, but otherwise look for companies intended specifically to replace car keys. Again, the older the vehicle and simpler the key, the easier it will be to replace. Amazon is a good place to start. Method 2 Replacing a New Electronic Car Key 1 Check to see if key replacement is covered by your warranty or car insurance. If you have a very new or high-end vehicle the key might not be replaced by anyone but the manufacturer or distributor. In this case, you may be able to get a discount through your warranty. Bring all your car’s information, a valid photo ID, and any other sets of keys you may have to the dealership. Hope for the best! 2 Visit your local locksmith. Depending on the sophistication of your car key you may be able to have a new electronic key programmed by a locksmith. Many new car keys have a microchip in them to prevent duplication. However, if you have a key with a transponder in it you can probably get a new one at a locksmith for around $50.00. Manufacturers started using transponders in the 1990’s – they are chips in the head of the key that communicate with the car. If the wrong key is in the ignition, the car will not start. Transponder keys are available at locksmiths, but laser cut keys, switchblade keys, and smart keys all need to be replaced by your dealer. [4] 3 Buy an aftermarket replacement car key. Search for ‘aftermarket electronic car keys’ on the Internet and you’ll find plenty of options for replacement electronic car keys. Oftentimes you’ll be able to get a new car key for 75 % less than what the dealer would charge you. Enter your vehicle’s VIN number on the website and check to see if they have an aftermarket key for your car available. 4 Get a new set of keys from your dealer. This will cost you upwards of $200. [5] However, if you just want a key that you know will work and you want to get it quickly and easily this is not a bad option. Visit your local dealer – if it’s a Honda, go to a Honda dealership, if it\u0027s a Ford go to a Ford dealership, etc.. 5 Program your new key to your car. you can program them to your specific car without a special technician. The instructions are usually included with the new key, but your owner’s manual will be very helpful in this situation. Depending on the car, reprogramming usually involves opening and closing the doors and/or turning lights and other electronics on and off. You press a series of buttons like a code, basically.  Method 3 Replacing a Malfunctioning Electric Key 1 Wait. Sometimes extreme heat or cold weather can cause your electric key to stop working properly. Also if you go on a run with your key in hand the sweat can work it’s way in there and cause some issues. Let your key rest for a little while before you pay money to replace it. It might come back to life. 2 Reset all your keys. A key fob may stop working properly after a change or repair to your car’s electrical systems (such as replacing the battery, for example). Find the owner’s manual for your particular car (or hunt one down online) and reset all the keys according to the instructions provided. 3 Replace the battery. If you notice your key working poorly over the span of a few days it might be the battery dying. A replacement battery for a key fob is usually inexpensive and can be found online or at an auto-locksmith. Make sure you have the make, model, year, and VIN number of the car. Most batteries should be simple enough for you to replace yourself. You unscrew the Philips screw at the back of the key, remove the old battery, and put the new one in. Voila! [6] You can also go straight to the dealer or manufacturer, but this may be more expensive, especially if they charge for labor when they install the new battery. Check your car’s warranty to see if battery replacement is covered. 4 Reprogram the key. If you don’t want to do this yourself, you can get help from some locksmiths or even the car’s dealership, but the simplest solution is usually to follow the instructions provided in your owner’s manual. Normally the reset involves pressing a series of buttons in a certain order but it’s different for every car. [7] Check your owners manual.

Remove as much debris from your car as possible before shampooing. Then, use special carpet and upholstery cleaners to scrub those respective areas of the car. Ad Steps Method 1 Preliminary Cleaning 1 Clear out any debris. Any wrappers, papers, stones, or other noticeable pieces of junk that have cluttered up your car interior until now must be cleared away before you can begin shampooing. 2 Vacuum the car interior. Vacuuming removes the majority of large dirt particles, making the process of shampooing both easier and more effective. Shampooing should be used primarily to get rid of greasy, smelly gunk that ordinary vacuuming or sweeping cannot remove. Method 2 Shampooing the Carpet 1 Select the right materials. A general spray-on carpet shampoo will work well enough for the carpet in your car. You should also use a stiff bristle brush, like a stiff tire brush made with soft plastic. 2 Work on one area of the carpet at a time.[1] To avoid having to soak and re-soak the car\u0027s carpet, focus your attention on one area of the car before moving onto the next, rather than shampooing the entire car at once. Oftentimes, people find it easiest to start with the driver\u0027s side floor before moving across the front of the car to the passenger\u0027s side, then circling around to the back. 3 Remove the floor mats. These must be cleaned separately from the rest of the car\u0027s carpet. 4 Pre-treat heavy stains on the carpet. Problematic stains like tar or oil may not be removed sufficiently by simple carpet shampoo. Use a cleaning product specifically geared toward treating these heavy stains to pre-treat the carpet before shampooing it. Follow the directions on the cleaner\u0027s label. Usually, you will need to spray or dab the stain lifter directly onto the stain, covering it completely. Allow it to soak for several minutes before washing. 5 Meanwhile, clean the removed floor mats. Spray an all-purpose cleaner or carpet shampoo on them, depending on whether or not there is any fabric on the mats. Scrub them with a stiff brush, rinse, and hang vertically to dry them out. Wait until they and your carpet are clean before putting the mats back in the car. 6 Spray the carpet with the shampoo. Apply an even spray along each area of the carpet as you work. Work the compound into the carpet using your brush. You can use a little excess shampoo on areas with tougher stains, but avoid over-applying the shampoo. Car carpets tend to be moisture-resistant, but if soaked, they can develop mildew with relative ease. 7 Soak up excess moisture as you work. After scrubbing the shampoo into the carpet and allowing it ample time to sit according to label directions—usually only several minutes—scrub extra moisture out of the carpet by firmly pressing a clean, dry towel along the freshly treated carpet. Move the towel along the carpet in a single direction, rather than scrubbing back and forth. Continue until the majority of dampness is removed, and allow the carpet to air dry the rest of the way by leaving the windows or doors of the car open. Direct an electric fan toward the carpet if desired. Method 3 Shampooing the Upholstery 1 Mix special upholstery shampoo into a bucket of water. You can use the same shampoo you used for the carpet, but one that is specifically designed for use with upholstery makes a better option. Use plenty of shampoo and mix vigorously to create a great deal of foam.[2] The shampoo foam itself is what you will use to clean the upholstery instead of the soapy water. Upholstery, especially when made of seat cloth or velour, has a tendency to look dry even after being soaked. As such, it is very easy to over-apply cleaner if using soapy water or a spray-on shampoo. 2 Focus on one area at a time. As you did with the car carpets, focus on cleaning one area of the upholstery at a time instead of applying the shampoo foam to the entire seating area at once. Begin on the same side you began cleaning the carpet from, and move in the same pattern. 3 Scoop some of the foam up with your brush and work it in. Lift the foam onto the bristles of your stiff bristle brush, getting as much foam as possible and as little actual water as possible. Transfer the foam onto the upholstery and firmly scrub it into the fabric using the brush. Use as little as possible to cover the upholstery. The foam in your bucket will likely die down as you work, so you may need to re-agitate the soapy shampoo water periodically to create more foam. If necessary, you may even mix in additional shampoo. 4 Remove excess water with a dry terry-cloth towel. Press the towel into the upholstery firmly, moving it along in straight, single-direction lines to wring excess water out of the seats and into the towel. 5 Allow the remainder to air dry. Most of the moisture will need to dry out naturally. Prevent mold or mildew from forming by leaving the windows rolled down or the car doors open, improving air circulation. You can even use an electric fan to speed the process along.

If you are painting over existing paint, the paint you put on your car is only as good as the coating beneath it. There are 3 major ways to strip paint from a car. You can sand cars that do not have multiple paint jobs, use chemical stripper for difficult jobs where you have to remove several layers of old paint or blast cars that have tight areas that you need to get into. Ad Steps Method 1 Remove Paint From a Car by Sanding 1 Wear a respirator. At the very least, you should have a dust mask. 2 Attach a 220-grit sanding disc to a dual-action (DA) sanding machine. Peel off the back of the sanding disc and attach it to the sander. 3 Sand the surface until you remove all the paint. 4 Switch the sanding disc to 400 grit and sand until smooth. Method 2 Strip Paint From a Car With a Chemical Stripper 1 Wear a respirator and heavy duty gloves for safety. 2 Remove everything from the exterior of the car that you do not want to ruin with the chemical stripper. Include all the rubber trim, fixtures and the glass. 3 Pour or brush the stripper onto the painted surface of the car body. Let it stand for as long as the packaging label requires. 4 Try scraping with a putty knife to see whether the surface is ready to scrape. If you cannot remove the paint easily, leave the stripper on longer or add a little more. 5 Scrape the entire surface using a putty knife. 6 Apply a second application of the stripper, if needed, and scrape again. 7 Rinse the car with water and let it dry. 8 Use course-grit sandpaper to remove any paint that remains and follow with a fine-grit sandpaper until smooth. Method 3 Remove Paint From a Car by Blasting 1 Wear a heavy shirt with long sleeves, a sandblasting hood, heavy gloves and a respirator. 2 Cover all the glass, chrome and the trim on the car or truck if you are using plastic particles for blasting. If you are using sandblasting, remove all the glass, trim and any chrome. You can cover the areas you want to protect with heavy material if you choose, but test it first to make sure the sand will not power right through it. 3 Choose what type of medium you would like to use for blasting. Media comes in various materials including plastic or sand, and you can use different-sized particles. A good range of size would be anything from a size 40 to a size 12. You can also use baking soda if there is not too many coats of paint and if the vehicle is rust free. 4 Choose the compressor and blaster nozzle that you will use for the job. Most nozzle sizes will state what horsepower the compressor must be to be compatible. 5 Add the media to your compressor. 6 Set the pressure to the correct setting, according to the media and size that chose. 7 Blast the car until you remove all the paint.

Ask it here: Submit Tips If sanding, you can use other types of sanding machines. However, dual-action sanders, although expensive, are the most effective way to sand. Use a quality respirator approved by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) when removing paint by chemical stripping or blasting. Be sure to read label directions and all warnings on the chemical stripper label. Always prepare your car by washing it and allowing it to dry before you begin. Warnings You must keep the DA sander flat against the surface of the car to prevent dents and gouging of the surface. Do not use heavy duty grinder sanding machines when removing paint from a car. They can actually dig into the sheet metal and leave marks that will show through the paint. Do not attempt to remove paint from a car unless you are in a well-ventilated area. When using a DA sander, never put 1 sanding disc over another. This could cause uneven sanding. Be aware that you could warp the surface if you media blast it too long in one area or if you blast with a medium that is too harsh. Do not sandblast sheet metal on the body of the car. Doing so will warp and damage the steel.

When it comes to measuring cylindrical or spherical objects, an outside micrometer would be the best tool to use. A well calibrated micrometer can be difficult to use, but with patience and practice, this tool can be a part of your skill set. Ad Steps Method 1 Measuring with the Micrometer 1 Familiarize yourself with the anatomy of a micrometer. Some parts are stationary while others are movable. Ratchet stop Thimble Frame Thimble lock Spindle Anvil Sleeve 2 Clean the anvil and spindle before beginning. Use either a clean sheet of paper or soft cloth, and hold it between the anvil and the spindle. Gently twist and close on the sheet or cloth. Slowly, pull out the sheet or the cloth.[1] This practice isn\u0027t a necessary step for measuring, but keeping the surfaces of the anvil and spindle clean ensures precise measurements. 3 Hold the object in your left hand and place it against the anvil. The anvil is stationary and can withstand more pressure than the spindle. Make sure the object doesn\u0027t move or scratch the surface of the anvil. 4 Hold the micrometer with your right hand. The frame will rest gently on your palm. You can also fasten the frame on a stationary vise; this helps free up both hands for the measuring process. 5 Spin the ratchet counter clockwise. Be sure the 0 on the thimble is lined up with the scale on the sleeve. 6 Twist until the spindle is against the object. Apply enough force. The thimble often clicks. Three clicks is a good stopping point. 7 Set the thimble lock while the micrometer is still on the object. Even though it is on lock, the spindle can still be moved. 8 Slide out the object carefully. Be sure to avoid scratching either surfaces of the anvil or spindle; the slightest scratch can ruin the micrometers measuring accuracy. 9 Write down the measurements before unlocking the spindle. If the spindle loosens, be sure to remeasure. Method 2 Reading an Inch Micrometer 1 Learn the different number scales on the thimbles.[2] On the sleeve is a scale that measures by the one-hundred thousands or 1/10 of an inch; in decimal form it would be .100. In between those whole numbers are three lines that represent twenty-five thousandths of an inch; in decimal form, it would look like .025. The thimble has evenly spaced lines that represent one-thousandth of an inch; in decimal form it would be .001. Above the whole number scale on the sleeve are lines that measure to ten-thousandths of an inch; in decimal form it looks like .0001. 2 Read the whole number on the sleeve first. The last visible number will read as the thousandths. For example, if the last number you can see on the sleeve is 5, then it would read 5 hundred thousandths, or .500. ” 3 Read how many lines come after the whole number. Look at the individual markings exposed next to the 100 thousandths and multiply each marking by .25.. In this case 1 x .025 would be .025. 4 Find the number and corresponding marking on the thimble scale closest to but underneath the measurement line on the stock. If it\u0027s closest to 1, then it would be .001. 5 Add those three numbers together. In this case it would be .500 + .025 + .001 \u003d .526. 6 Flip the micrometer over to read to the 10 thousandths marking. Read that line that lines closest with the sleeve. If, for example, it lines with 1, then the measurement will will read .5261 Method 3 Reading a Metric Micrometer 1 Learn the different number scales on the thimbles.[3] The line on the sleeve usually has top line showing millimeters, and below that line the marks represent half millimeters. The marks on the thimble usually go to 50, and each line represents a hundredth of a millimeter or .01 mm. The horizontal lines above the scale on the sleeve will measure to the thousandth of a millimeter, or .001 mm. 2 Read the number of millimeters first. If the last line you saw were a 5, then you would have 5 mm thus far. 3 Incorporate all the half millimeters in your measurement. If you have one mark that would be .5 mm. Don\u0027t count a mark that is barely showing; the reading on the thimble might be getting close to 50. [4] 4 Find the number of .01 millimeters. If the line on the thimble reads 33, then you\u0027d have .33 mm. 5 Add up all three lines. In this example, add 5 + .5 + .33. The measurement is 5.83 mm. 6 Add the thousandths. If the thousandths read a 6, then at .006 to the measurement. In this example, it would be 5.836 The main time you should incorporate the thousandths measurement is if the object has less tolerance for the pressure applied by the micrometer.[5] Reader Questions and Answers Unanswered Questions What is a veiner gauge?

Remember also that an outside micrometer, when used correctly, is much more accurate than calipers. Measure the desired object multiple times as a check on your work. Zero out the micrometer often to ensure readings are correct. When storing the anvil and the spindle should be left away from each other (open), so that temperature variations do not stress the device. The instrument is highly heat sensitive and should be stored at room temperature. Warnings It is assumed when a micrometer is used, that an accurate and precise measurement is desired. Ensure your micrometer is properly calibrated. They do lose accuracy with use, and must be adjusted every 36 months according to NIST. Check more often when frequently used. Things You\u0027ll Need Micrometer Micrometer tools: Standard – The standard is an item of precisely calibrated length and flatness which is used to verify the accuracy of the micrometer or to reset it if it is found to be inaccurate. Standards are typically a round or rectangular piece of steel. They are employed just prior to using a micrometer or may be used on a set schedule as part of a calibration program. Wrench – insert in hole on back of the stock to adjust the micrometer if needed.

As a general rule, when dealing with two gears, if the driving gear (the one directly receiving rotational force from the engine, motor, etc.) is bigger than the driven gear, the latter will turn more quickly, and vice versa. We can express this basic concept with the formula Gear ratio \u003d T2/T1, where T1 is the number of teeth on the first gear and T2 is the number of teeth on the second.[1] Ad Steps Method 1 Finding the Gear Ratio of a Gear Train Two Gears 1 Start with a two-gear train. To be able to determine a gear ratio, you must have at least two gears engaged with each other — this is called a \"gear train.\" Usually, the first gear is a \"drive gear\" attached to the motor shaft and the second is a \"driven gear\" attached to the load shaft. There may also be any number of gears between these two to transmit power from the drive gear to the driven gear: these are called \"idler gears.\" For now, let\u0027s look at a gear train with only two gears in it. To be able to find a gear ratio, these gears have to be interacting with each other — in other words, their teeth need to be meshed and one should be turning the other. For example purposes, let\u0027s say that you have one small drive gear (gear 1) turning a larger driven gear (gear 2). 2 Count the number of teeth on the drive gear. One simple way to find the gear ratio between two interlocking gears is to compare the number of teeth (the little peg-like protrusions at the edge of the wheel) that they both have. Start by determining how many teeth are on the drive gear. You can do this by counting manually or, sometimes, by checking for this information labeled on the gear itself. For example purposes, let\u0027s say that the smaller drive gear in our system has 20 teeth. 3 Count the number of teeth on the driven gear. Next, determine how many teeth are on the driven gear exactly as you did before for the drive gear. Let\u0027s say that, in our example, the driven gear has 30 teeth. 4 Divide one teeth count by the other. Now that you know how many teeth are on each gear, you can find the gear ratio relatively simply. Divide the driven gear teeth by the drive gear teeth. Depending on your assignment, you may write your answer as a decimal, a fraction, or in ratio form (i.e., x : y). In our example, dividing the 30 teeth of the driven gear by the 20 teeth of the drive gear gets us 30/20 \u003d 1.5. We can also write this as 3/2 or 1.5 : 1, etc. What this gear ratio means is that the smaller driver gear must turn one and a half times to get the larger driven gear to make one complete turn. This makes sense — since the driven gear is bigger, it will turn more slowly.[2] More than Two Gears 1 Start with a gear train of more than two gears. As its name suggests, a \"gear train\" can also be made from a long sequence of gears — not just a single driver gear and a single driven gear. In these cases, the first gear remains the driver gear, the last gear remains the driven gear, and the ones in the middle become \"idler gears.\" These are often used to change the direction of rotation or to connect two gears when direct gearing would make them unwieldy or not readily available.[3] Let\u0027s say for example purposes that the two-gear train described above is now driven by a small seven-toothed gear. In this case, the 30-toothed gear remains the driven gear and the 20-toothed gear (which was the driver before) is now an idler gear. 2 Divide the teeth numbers of the drive and driven gears. The important thing to remember when dealing with gear trains with more than two gears is that only the driver and driven gears (usually the first and last ones) matter. In other words, the idler gears don\u0027t affect the gear ratio of the overall train at all. When you\u0027ve identified your driver gear and your driven gear, you can find the gear ratio exactly as before. In our example, we would find the gear ratio by dividing the thirty teeth of the driven gear by the seven teeth of our new driver. 30/7 \u003d about 4.3 (or 4.3 : 1, etc.) This means that the driver gear has to turn about 4.3 times to get the much larger driven gear to turn once. 3 If desired, find the gear ratios for the intermediate gears. You can find the gear ratios involving the idler gears as well, and you may want to in certain situations. In these cases, start from the drive gear and work toward the load gear. Treat the preceding gear as if it were the drive gear as far as the next gear is concerned. Divide the number of teeth on each \"driven\" gear by the number of teeth on the \"drive\" gear for each interlocking set of gears to calculate the intermediate gear ratios. In our example, the intermediate gear ratios are 20/7 \u003d 2.9 and 30/20 \u003d 1.5. Note that neither of these are equal to the gear ratio for the entire train, 4.3. However, note also that (20/7) × (30/20) \u003d 4.3. In general, the intermediate gear ratios of a gear train will multiply together to equal the overall gear ratio. Method 2 Making Ratio/Speed Calculations 1 Find the rotational speed of your drive gear. Using the idea of gear ratios, it\u0027s easy to figure out how quickly a driven gear is rotating based on the \"input\" speed of the drive gear. To start, find the rotational speed of your drive gear. In most gear calculations, this is given in rotations per minute (rpm), though other units of velocity will also work. For example, let\u0027s say that in the example gear train above with a seven-toothed driver gear and a 30-toothed driven gear, the drive gear is rotating at 130 rpms. With this information, we\u0027ll find the speed of the driven gear in the next few steps. 2 Plug your information into the formula S1 × T1 \u003d S2 × T2. In this formula, S1 refers to the rotational speed of the drive gear, T1 refers to the teeth in the drive gear, and S2 and T2 to the speed and teeth of the driven gear. Fill in the variables until you have only one left undefined. Often, in these sorts of problems, you\u0027ll be solving for S2, though it\u0027s perfectly possible to solve for any of the variables. In our example, plugging in the information we have, we get this: 130 rpms × 7 \u003d S2 × 30 3 Solve. Finding your remaining variable is a matter of basic algebra. Just simplify the rest of the equation and isolate the variable on one side of the equals sign and you will have your answer. Don\u0027t forget to label it with the correct units — you can lose points for this in schoolwork. In our example, we can solve like this: 130 rpms × 7 \u003d S2 × 30 910 \u003d S2 × 30 910/30 \u003d S2 30.33 rpms \u003d S2 In other words, if the drive gear spins at 130 rpms, the driven gear will spin at 30.33 rpms. This makes sense — since the driven gear is much bigger, it will spin much slower. Reader Questions and Answers Unanswered Questions What gear reduction do I need to go from 1750 to 6?

Notice that it is easiest to go up hills when you have a small gear in front and a big one in the back. While it\u0027s easier to turn the smaller gear with the leverage from your pedals, it takes many rotations to get your rear wheel to rotate compared to the gear settings you\u0027d use for flat sections, making you go slower. A geared down system (where load RPM is less than motor RPM) will require a motor that delivers optimal power at higher rotational speeds. The power needed to drive the load is geared up or down from the motor by the gear ratio. The motor must be sized to provide the power needed by the load after the gear ratio is taken in to consideration. A geared up system (where load RPM is greater than motor RPM) will require a motor that delivers optimal power at lower rotational speeds.

Removing this rust with household objects is surprisingly easy with some elbow grease, but more serious follow-up maintenance may be required if the rust is widespread and much of the chrome has flaked off. Ad Steps Method 1 Removing Rust Using Aluminum Foil 1 Use aluminum foil for an easy, low-cost method for removing rust from chrome. Aluminum reacts with rust chemically, resulting in a material that can be easily wiped or scrubbed off. Since aluminum is softer than most metals, it will not scratch the surface of the chrome or the metal underneath it.[1] 2 Clean the chrome. Before you attempt to remove the rust on the chrome, clean dirt and debris from the metal using soapy water, or with car wash soap if cleaning painted car parts. This helps you locate and access rusty areas more easily. For very dirty or very rusty surfaces, use vinegar or another mild acid suggested below, then follow up with foil. 3 Dip aluminum foil into water. You can use any water, but saltwater is best, since the electrolytes and salts will help speed up the chemical process. Tear off strips of aluminum convenient to use on the rusted area. 4 Rub the aluminum foil over the rust spots. Rub the aluminum foil back and forth over the rust spots. You do not need to use much pressure, although heavily rusted areas may require slightly more effort and a longer rubbing time. Dip the aluminum foil in water again whenever it gets dry. If you are working on a severely pitted surface then try wadding up the piece of aluminum foil. The edges that this creates will help to smooth down the metal and will actually fill in the pitted rust areas. 5 Stop every so often to remove the rust residue. Whenever the rust residue gets too thick, stop and wipe the residue using a rag or towel. This way you can see the remaining rust and continue rubbing it with the aluminum foil. 6 Rinse the surface of the chrome. Once you have removed all the rust, wipe the surface using a rag to reveal the shiny metal underneath. 7 Dry the chrome completely. Water spots show up very easily on chrome surfaces, and can cause further rust of the metal below. Use a paper towel or blow dryer to dry the surface. If necessary, consult the section on follow-up care to repair damage and prevent further rust. Be sure to apply a coat of polish or wax on your clean chrome to prevent more rust from forming. Method 2 Removing Rust Using Mild Acid 1 Use cola, lime juice, or other mild household acids. Any cola or soda that includes phosphoric acid in the ingredients can be used to remove rust. Other options include lime juice or vinegar. These mild acids can remove rust without significant risk to the surrounding metal. Diet cola does not have sugar in it, so the process will be less sticky. However, the sugar does help the acid to adhere to the rust. Avoid strong or concentrated acids, which can etch and weaken the underlying metal. If these household acids are ineffective, try again with phosphoric acid, but keep a fan on to blow corrosive fumes away from your face. 2 Clean the chrome. Before you attempt to remove the rust on the chrome it is best to make sure all the dirt and other debris are removed. This helps you to see and access the rust more easily for removal. Use car wash soap to clean painted surfaces on cars, and regular soapy water for other chrome objects. 3 Soak or cover the chrome with the acid. Ideally, soak the object for 15 minutes before removing. If you cannot soak the object, then simply pour the mild acid over the surface. 4 Wipe or scrub the rust off. You may need to use a rough sponge or gentle dish scrubber to remove the dissolved rust. Scrubbers designed for use on glass cookware tend to have the lowest risk of scratching your chrome. To remove heavy rust, rub gently with strips of aluminum foil or scrub with scouring pads. 5 Wash off residue with a safe soap. If you are cleaning a car, use car wash soap to remove the rust and acid residue. Dish soap should not be used on painted car surfaces, since it may strip the paint. Unpainted surfaces can be cleaned using any ordinary soap and water. 6 Dry and care for the car. Remove moisture with paper towels to minimize further rust. If the rust has caused noticeable damage, refer to the section on follow up care. Apply a coat of polish or wax on the chrome to prevent rust from forming in the future. Method 3 Removing Rust Using Oil or Chrome Polish 1 Use chrome polish for the quickest removal, or oil to save money. Chrome polish is the most expensive of the methods for removing rust, but a quality product will make removal quick and easy. A light penetrating oil such as WD40, CLR, or CRC can be used instead, and is typically the cheaper option. 2 Clean the chrome using soapy water. Before you attempt to remove the rust on the chrome it is best to make sure all the dirt and other debris are removed. This helps you to see and access the rust more easily for removal. If the dirt is very difficult to remove you can also use vinegar to clean the surface of the chrome. Vinegar is a mild acid and will help in the process of rust removal as well. 3 Apply oil or chrome polish to the rusted area. Spread the cleaning substance over the rusted area on the chrome and make sure it is coated completely to avoid scratching the surface. 4 Apply oil or chrome polish to brass wool or fine steel wool. Soft brass wool or a brass wire brush is best for this purpose, since it is less likely to cause major scratches. If you cannot find brass wool, use the finest steel wool available, preferably grade #0000. Coating it with additional chrome polish will also help prevent scratching. 5 Rub the wool gently over the rusted area. Gently rub using a circular motion while making sure that the surface is moist at all times. Do not apply pressure while rubbing or else you will damage the surface. If the area gets dry then be sure to add more oil or chrome polish. Rubbing dry chrome with metal wool will scratch and damage the surface. 6 Rinse the area with clean water. Rinse off the metal polish and removed rust by washing the area with water. 7 Check for additional rust spots. If the surface of the chrome is not completely free of rust spots then use additional chrome polish to try to remove the spots using the same method. 8 Dry the chrome completely. Water spots show up very easily on chrome surfaces so it is best to dry the chrome completely to make it shiny and brilliant. Make sure to put a coat of polish or wax on the chrome to keep the rust from reforming. If extra care is needed, check out the followup section below. Method 4 Repairing and Protecting Chrome after Rust Removal 1 Buff and dry the surface. If the rust only showed through the chrome in pinpricks, drying the surface with a towel after cleaning may be enough to keep up the chrome\u0027s appearance. 2 Protect the metal using polish or wax. Apply a wax or polish to the chrome to protect it from any further damage. Use a product only for its intended purpose, such as car wax for chrome-plated vehicles. Typically, wax is applied, buffed and left to dry, then a second layer is applied over it and buffed again. 3 Apply silver paint. This will keep a nice shine on the chrome, but the level of rust protection depends on the brand of paint and how well it is applied. Select a paint appropriate to the task, typically automotive paint, and apply as evenly as possible over areas pitted by rust damage. Use a fine, 1200 grit sandpaper to smooth it down after it dries, taking care to avoid sanding unpainted areas. 4 Get the object re-chromed. This is an expensive option, usually only performed on cars that were severely damaged by rust. Hire a mechanic who offers a chrome plating service if you want to re-chrome your car. If you\u0027re feeling ambitious, you can try to chrome plate objects at home, especially if they are relatively small.

Answer this question Flag as bad question Flag as bad question Show more unanswered questions Add New Question Answered Questions Don\u0027t see your question? Ask it here: Submit Video Tips Typically, materials are chrome plated to protect them from rust. When rust develops, it is typically because the chrome has flaked away in spots, leaving the underlying iron or steel vulnerable to rust damage. In severe cases, the rust can spread to surrounding areas and cause bubbles underneath the chrome coating. Rust will reappear quickly if the surface becomes wet, so make sure you thoroughly dry the surface if exposed to water. Add a layer of chrome polish to the surface soon after it has dried. This will prevent new rust from forming. Warnings Sandblasting or grinding is not recommended, since they can easily damage the underlying metal. Some cars use plastic or paint that imitates chrome, not chrome itself. While these methods work on the rust itself, not the chrome, they may have unpredictable effects if your car is trimmed with an unidentified substance.

This is controlled by the engine\u0027s computer. Sometimes parts go bad, which results in your car idling strangely or stalling. You can learn how to check an idle air control valve so you can decide whether or not you should replace it. Ad Steps Method 1 General Motors 1 See if the \"check engine\" light is on. If it is, use an OBD II scanner to retrieve the codes if the car is 1996 or newer. If the codes are between P505 to P509, you have a problem with the idle control system that might be the idle air control (IAC) valve. Be aware that an (IAC) valve can have an issue or fault without triggering a check engine light as well. 2 Older cars may have a code that can be retrieved by an original OBD scanner. The code 11 signals the same idle control problem as newer cars. The diagnostic procedure is the same for both. 3 Disconnect your IAC valve and turn on your car. At this point your idle speed should rise like it\u0027s supposed to. 4 Turn off your car and reconnect your IAC. Restart the car and your idle speed should go back to normal. If it does, this might rule out the IAC but further testing is necessary. Try obtaining one from a junk yard if the ]cost of a new one is prohibited and see if that makes any difference. 5 Use a test light if the idle speed did not do what it was supposed to. Hook it up to the idle air control solenoid and watch the light. The light will either flash or become dimmer for the four circuits if the valve is at fault. If it doesn\u0027t, it means the wiring or the computer (powertrain control module) is bad. Method 2 Ford 1 See if the \"check engine\" light is on. If it is, use an OBD II scanner for 1996 and newer vehicles to retrieve the codes. Like General Motors, if the codes are P505 to P509, you have a problem with the idle control system. If your car is older than a \u002796, you need a regular OBD scanner. You may get codes 12, 13, 16, 17, or 19, which indicates your idle is wrong. Sometimes codes 47 or 48 appear, which indicates an air leak. Again, an idle air control valve can have an issue or fault without triggering a check engine light. 2 Turn the car off and unplug the IAC (idle air control) solenoid if any of the codes mentioned above are found. 3 Restart the engine and check if the idle RPM has dropped. If there\u0027s no change in the idle speed, the solenoid has a problem. 4 Use an ohm meter to check the solenoid by attaching the positive lead to the VPWR (vehicle power pin) and the negative lead to the IAC pin. Your resistance reading should be between 7.0 ohms and 13.0 ohms. If your reading is off, your IAC solenoid is bad. Method 3 Chrysler 1 Use a scanner (OBD for vehicles older than 1996 or OBD II for newer vehicles) to retrieve codes if the engine light is on. A code 25 in older cars or P505 to P509 in newer vehicles indicates a problem with the idle control system. Even if your \"check engine\" light isn\u0027t illuminated, you may have an issue with your idle air control valve. 2 Use a bidirectional scanner to test the idle speed by sending commands to it. If the engine does not respond to your commands, there is a problem with the IAC solenoid, wiring, or driving circuit. Method 4 Other Car Manufacturers 1 Check your car repair guide for specific instructions. The process should be similar to one of the three described above, but there may be added steps or a combination of methods.

New paint, interior upgrades and a myriad of other aftermarket accessories can help you to create the car of your dreams. Ad Steps Method 1 Body Modifications 1 Modify the body for a one-of-a-kind look. Some of the most dramatic car customization options stem from body modifications. Changing the look of a stock car quickly sets it apart from the pack. Chop the roof. Create a dramatic change to a car\u0027s profile by removing a few inches of height from the roof area. Typically, the window posts are cut to remove the roof, then a few inches of the posts are removed and the roof is welded back in place. Upgrade the doors. Add panache to your vehicle by modifying your stock doors into show-stopping suicide-style, gull-wing or flip-up doors. For added effect, \"shave\" the door handles off the vehicle and install an electronic opening system so everyone will wonder how you get into your custom car. Modify body features. On older hot rods, try installing the car\u0027s bumper upside down. This simple hot rod trick gives a new look to an old vehicle. You can also remove the bolts from the bumpers and grind them smooth and re-chrome. Re-install the bumper using hidden bolts. Other options include installing a custom grill, relocating or changing the style of your car\u0027s headlights and taillights, and modifying the antennae to a French, hidden or a power model. Method 2 Accessories 1 Add a variety of accessories to complete your car\u0027s new look. You have the option of making changes all at once, or if budget dictates, little by little. Install aftermarket accessories. Add a custom steering wheel, light-up shifter knob and window tint for a truly custom look. Acid-etch windows or have the glass machine-etched with flowers, designs or the name of your car club. Update your interior by changing out bench seats for bucket seats, replacing your vehicle\u0027s carpet and installing a custom-made tuck-and-roll interior. To further enhance your car\u0027s interior, install a sunroof or moon roof, and a high-tech audio system. Method 3 Wheels, Tires and Suspension 1 Add custom wheels and change the diameter and width of the stock tires. Choose low-profile or wide tires, and sizes which will raise or lower the vehicle\u0027s stance. For a more dramatic effect, add airbags or hydraulics to raise and lower the vehicle\u0027s suspension. Method 4 Paint 1 Change the stock color of your vehicle to one not offered by the manufacturer. Top it off with custom graphics, flames and pinstriping. Whether you choose a black satin finish or bright red with silver metal flake, custom paint will make your vehicle stand out. Add graphics, pinstripes or flames to further customize your car.

Ad Steps Method 1 Low Transmission Fluid Level 1 Check the dipstick on the automatic transmission. Check the owner\u0027s manual for the correct procedure for your vehicle — generally, manufacturers prefer testing with a warm engine. Be sure to check the fluid when parked on a level surface. Do your best to not allow any lint or dirt to contaminate the dip stick before reinserting. Method 2 Clogged Catalytic Converter 1 Look for stalling, no power when accelerating. The check engine light will likely be on. 2 Look under the car at night after the vehicle has been running for a while. If the catalytic converter is glowing, it\u0027s probably clogged. You will have to replace the converter if you find this to be the problem. Method 3 Broken O2 Sensors 1 Look for initial idle OK after a cold engine start-up, but a warm engine idle will surge and stall. 2 Take your car in to get a reading. After a few thousand miles of this, most cars will turn on the \"check engine\" light. You can take it to any AutoZone, Advance auto parts, Napa, or O\u0027Reilly\u0027s (but some places may only check cars made after 1996, so call and check first) and they will read the codes for free. There can be any number of reasons for the \"check engine\" light to come on, so it is good to check. Codes complaining of unexpected lean mixture is a good indication of O2 sensor failure. O2 sensors will typically last 60–75K miles. The good news is that you can buy an O2 sensor on-line for around $50 and they are generally pretty easy to replace. Another possible reason is that the engine is idling too low (the idle is adjustable) or the control module is going out, which is relatively inexpensive and easy to access and fix. Method 4 Clogged/Stuck EGR Valve 1 Look for the Engine Code Error (EGE) P1406. If the EGR valve is stuck open, the car will run sluggish at lower RPMs. If the valve is stuck closed, the car won\u0027t run well at higher RPMs (on the highway). 2 Try cleaning the excess carbon out of the EGR valve first. It may just need to be cleaned and not need replacing. If cleaning the EGR valve does not work and you are still getting code P1406, the EGR valve needs to be replaced.

Clean your throttle body and intake manifold. Most likely the AFRs (air to fuel ratio) may be off, causing it to run too rich or too lean. Buy a can of throttle body cleaner and spray it in and around generously, while the vehicle is running. If that doesn\u0027t work, try running some seafoam through a vacuum hose while vehicle is running and also pour some in the gas tank. The fuel injectors could be clogged or need to be cleaned. Helpful? Thanks! 0 0 Don\u0027t see your question? Ask it here: Submit Tips In vehicles with automatic transmissions that sometimes have a problem with stalling at lights or stop signs, most of the time it is a difference in pressure on each side of the pressure plate. A loss of pressure on one side or another will cause a stall. When you have low transmission fluid and come to a stop, most of the fluid travels to the front of the transmission and you get a difference in pressure that causes your car to stall. Check your transmission fluid. If you have to check the fluid with the car running, make sure to set the parking brake. Most cars will ask you to put the car in Park or Neutral. Make sure you do not have the car in gear. The car may be just idling too low which can be adjusted very easily with a screwdriver if you drive an older car. There is a small screw on the throttle body where the throttle cable connects to it you can adjust the screw to make the car idle smoother. Warnings Often, you will have to reach into cramped, hot spaces to check your fluid. Check your manual for the proper location. Take care not to be burned by engine parts. Wear long sleeve shirts or gloves as appropriate. Also, when adding fluid, it is a good idea to use a funnel with an appropriate length of neck. Use the proper type for your vehicle. Do not overfill. Inspect the EGR valve while outdoors, or in a well-ventilated area, to reduce exposure to fumes from the carburetor cleaner or exhaust.

The exception comes into play when your frame isn’t strong enough to support that power, but don’t fear. There is a way give your frame more support. When you install subframe connectors on your car, you increase the strength and rigidity of its body. While welding on the subframe connectors is prefered, there is an option for bolt-on subframe connectors. It is also possible to use bolt-on connectors and then weld them to the chassis later. Ad This article is \"in use\", indicating that it is undergoing a major edit. As a courtesy, please do not edit this article while this message is displayed. This notice was placed on 2016-03-27. If this was over two weeks ago, please contact the editor who added this notice to see if they are finished with the article before removing the tag. The editor will be listed in the article\u0027s edit history. If there is no response from them within 5-7 days, anyone may remove the tag. Steps Method 1 Preparing to Install Subframe Connectors 1 Check the structural components of the car for rust. Subframe connectors work to increase the strength of your frame, but this won’t help much if there are weak points due to rust. You should repair any rust spots before installing your subframe connectors. 2 Disassemble your interior. What comes out will depend heavily upon where you are making welds. You should remove any seats, carpet, stereo equipment, etc. that might get too hot and ignite due to your welding underneath it. This helps to prevent fires inside the car while you’re welding. If you are using the bolt-on only method of installing subframe connectors, this step is not necessary at all. 3 Lift the car. This seems simple, but it can be tricky. Your car needs to be as level as possible to minimize body flex. If your car is uneven, it twists and flexes the body. If you then weld the subframe connectors in while the body is twisted, you weld in that distortion and make it permanent. You should use ramps or a drive-on body lift. 4 Move the fuel line and the fuel tank out of the way. You do NOT want to ignite the fuel line or tank while welding. Do not shortcut this step. If you need to remove the fuel lines and tank do it. Method 2 Installing Bolt-On Subframe Connectors 1 Check drill clearance underneath your car. It may be necessary to move or remove parts of the exhaust in order to properly fit the drill underneath your car and install the subframe connectors.[1] This will depend on the make and model of your vehicle. 2 Identify which connector goes on which side. This is easily done, as the connectors are different for either side. Make sure that you are not mixing them up.[2] 3 Place the subframe connectors as close as possible to the frame rail. Place a piece of wood between the subframe connector and a hydraulic jack and use the jack to hold the connector in place against the frame rail.[3] 4 Install the cross brace nuts. The cross brace fits over the seat bolts and is secured by a nylock nut and washer for each seat bolt.[4] This will help hold the connector in place while you drill the holes for the bolts. 5 Drill the necessary holes. With the subframe connector in place, put the drill bit in a bolt hole on the subframe connector and drill straight through the frame rail from the outside toward the center of the car. Next, go underneath your car and drill through the other side of the frame rail the same way, but this time you will be drilling from the center toward the outside of the car. Do this for all bolt holes on your subframe connectors.[5] Lining up the subframe connectors first and drilling through the bolt holes makes sure that the holes are aligned such that a bolt can go straight through. 6 Install your bolts. Now that the holes are all cut in, you can install your bolts. Thread them through one side to the other and attach them with any washers and nuts provided. Tighten to the recommended torque listed by the manufacturer. Method 3 Welding in Subframe Connectors 1 Mark your welding locations. A white grease pencil works well for this. You will weld at the front and back of the subframe connectors. If you have end caps for your connectors, you will weld those on as well. It is also advised that you weld patches in regular intervals along the sides of your connectors.[6] 2 Clean all welding surfaces. This can be done with a wire wheel attached to a drill. Strip all mounting points on the car and mounting plates on the connectors down to bare metal for welding.[7] 3 Raise the subframe connectors into place. Just like with the bolt-on option, you will need your subframe connector to be in place along the frame rail. You can use a wooden block and a hydraulic jack to properly fit the subframe connector up against the frame rail.. If your connectors have a bolt-on option, bolt one side in to help hold the connector in place during welding. 4 Verify there are no gaps greater than 1/8-inch. You need the metal of the frame rail to be close enough to the metal of the subframe connector to place sturdy welds. 5 Secure the connectors to the car using 6-inch clamps. You want to prevent the subframe connector from moving while you are welding it into place.[8] The connector needs to be flush with the inner rail, but don\u0027t be concerned if the outer connector doesn\u0027t align with the body of the car.[9] 6 Weld the connectors in place at the front and back. Welding the connector will take some time. The weld needs to run around the connector mounting plates and the car’s subframe.[10] If your connectors include end caps, secure the end caps and weld them in place as well. Method 4 Reassembling Your Vehicle 1 Reattach any exhaust components. If you had to remove any parts of the exhaust to make room for the drill or welder, reattach them now. 2 Reinstall the fuel tank and lines. It is likely that these were removed, especially if you were welding on your frame rails. Now that all of the welding is done, it is safe to reinstall your fuel lines and fuel tank. 3 Reinstall all interior pieces. If you removed carpet or other interior items to protect them from welding, you should reinstall them. 4 Enjoy the ride. Subframe connectors improve the handling and quality of your ride, go out and enjoy the upgrade. Reader Questions and Answers Unanswered Questions Show more unanswered questions Add New Question Answered Questions Don\u0027t see your question? Ask it here: Submit Tips Some choose to paint over their subframe connectors after the welding process. You should use a primer designed to protect the metal from rust at the very least. If you are installing bolt-on connectors, install the bolts from the center of the car to the outside (with the washer and nut on the outside of the frame rail). This will prevent you from needing to saw off the end of the bolt to make room for reinstalling other parts underneath the car. Warnings Wear protective equipment and follow the manufacturer’s guidelines for all of the tools used during the installation process. Take great care when removing oil, transmission fluids and road grime from the car as it can ignite when it heats up from the friction of the wire wheel.

Some such as overheating, are simple to fix - just turn your engine off until it cools down. Others are a bit more involved. Ad Steps Method 1 Increasing the Octane Level in your Fuel 1 Check to make sure you are using the proper fuel. In order for the fuel to ignite at the proper time during the combustion cycle, you have to use at least the recommended minimum octane level. In the US this is usually 87, but there are some higher end performance cars that require higher.[1]Check your owner’s manual if you are unsure what octane rating your car uses. 2 Add an octane booster. If you discover that you have been using the wrong fuel, you can add an octane booster to your tank. This will increase the octane level of your fuel, allowing you to use the gas in your tank.[2] 3 Buy the right gas. Using an octane booster to get through your last tank of low octane fuel is fine, but from now on you want to buy the right kind of fuel. You should also keep in mind that whatever low octane fuel is left in your tank when you fill up will mix with your new fuel, so if knocking continues go ahead and use the octane booster for another fill up or two until most of the low octane fuel is gone. It is also thought that using a \"top-tier\" gasoline such as shell or chevron will decrease engine deposits that can cause knocking.[3] Method 2 Cleaning Your Combustion Chamber 1 Consider cleaning your cylinders. Again, using the wrong fuel can be an issue. Not only can it cause knocking by igniting at the wrong time, it can also leave excess contaminants in your cylinders as a result of poor combustion.[4] If you are now using the proper fuel, you may need to clean out the contaminants left by past fuels. 2 Use a fuel additive. While most fuels have a specified amount of detergent in them (at least in the US), this may not always be enough to keep your combustion chamber clean. Using top tier gasoline brands will provide more detergents that help keep your engine clean.z[5] Another way to clean your cylinders is to add a detergent to your fuel. This is as easy as buying a fuel additive at your local parts store and pouring it into your gas tank at your next fill up.[6] 3 Flush your engine. If detergent hasn\u0027t gotten your engine running right, you can try an engine flush such as Amsoil or Wynn\u0027s. These will flush your combustion chamber and remove carbon deposits.[7] 4 Test your car. Start the engine and listen closely. Your knocking engine should be running smoothly now. Method 3 Replacing your Spark Plugs 1 Consult your owner\u0027s manual or a local parts store to find the correct spark plugs. A faulty spark plug can be the cause of engine knocking, and is bad for your engine overall.[8] 2 Prepare to work on your vehicle. Find all of the tools you will need, such as a spark plug socket and gap gauge.[9] Turn off your engine and unhook your battery terminals. 3 Check your spark plugs. You want to be sure that replacing the spark plugs will help. You can usually tell if there is a problem just by the residue left on your spark plug. A normal plug should have only brownish grey residue on the side electrode. If this is the only residue and the plug is otherwise intact, you should just clean it rather than replace it.[10] 4 Remove and replace your spark plugs. This is relatively a relatively quick job and should take about an hour.[11] If you have never changed spark plugs before you should consult How to Change Spark Plugs in a Car 5 Hook your battery terminals back up. Remember to do this in the correct order. First hook up the positive cable (usually red) and then the ground wire (usually black). Method 4 Checking Your Car’s Timing 1 Find the timing mark on your engine. This is usually located in a small gap in the transmission bell housing. You are looking for a gap with short marks perpendicular to it. The marks will be numbered to eight or twelve, with zero in the middle. The word “Before” and “after” may also be stamped into the metal near the gap.[12] Sometimes the gap is covered with a plastic or rubber cap. This keeps dirt out of the bellhousing.[13] 2 Identify spark plug number one. This is the plug you should use to check engine timing. You can look in your owner’s manual or service manual if you are unsure which spark plug is number one on your vehicle. It is not necessarily the first one on either end of the block.[14] 3 Set your park brake. Make sure that your car is parked safely and that it will not move while you are working. 4 Turn on your engine. You should let the engine warm up before checking the timing. This will yield the most accurate results.[15] 5 Connect your timing light to your number one spark plug wire. Clip the lead over the plug wire and turn on the light. Be sure that you are using the number one plug, otherwise your readings will be incorrect.[16] 6 Aim the timing light at the timing mark. When the spark plug fires, it will cause the strobe on the light to flash. This will show you what number the timing mark is on at the time the piston fires.[17] Record these numbers. 7 Interpret the results of your timing test. The numbers represent degrees from top dead center (TDC) of the piston in the number one cylinder. What this means, is that the mark indicates how far from the top the piston is when the spark ignites the fuel. If your numbers are in the specified range, your timing does not need adjusted.[18][19] If not, you will need to adjust your timing to fix the knocking.

Ask it here: Submit Tips Try cleaning the combustion chamber and changing fuels before moving directly to changing spark plugs. Change spark plugs one at a time.[20] Clean the metal around the timing mark so that you can see it clearly. Warnings Knocking is not fixed by switching to synthetic oil. IF your knocking is a result of an oil issue, it is that your car is very low on oil and you should add oil IMMEDIATELY to avoid serious damage.[21] If the procedures listed above do not cure the knock, it may be an indicator of a more serious problem. Have a professional check your car as you may be having issues with your cooling system, your drive belt components, crankshaft bearings, or flywheel. Only attempt to diagnose or repair these serious problems if you have mechanical experience.[22] Things You\u0027ll Need Ratchet Spark Plug Socket Gap Tester Fuel Detergent Octane Booster Related wikiHows How to Repair a Tow Rope How to Fix Your Car\u0027s Air Conditioner How to Extend the Life of Your Car How to Change the Oil in Your Car Sources and Citations Show Sources and Citations (22) ? http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-drive/culture/commuting/why-your-cars-engine-might-be-knocking-hint-its-not-the-oil/article11998780/ ? http://www.carsdirect.com/car-repair/3-causes-of-engine-knock ? http://www.toptiergas.com/deposit-control/ ? http://www.carsandparts.com/en/experts/tech-tips/2011/08/understanding-and-treating-engine-deposits-1.html ? http://www.toptiergas.com/deposit-control/ ? http://www.carsdirect.com/car-repair/3-causes-of-engine-knock ? http://www.carsandparts.com/en/experts/tech-tips/2011/08/understanding-and-treating-engine-deposits-1.html ? http://www.carsdirect.com/car-repair/3-causes-of-engine-knock ? http://www.familyhandyman.com/automotive/car-maintenance/how-to-replace-spark-plugs/view-all ? http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/how-to-assess-trouble-by-checking-your-spark-plugs.html ? http://www.dmv.org/how-to-guides/plugs.php ? http://www.geeksoncars.com/how_5835748_check-timing-car.html ? http://www.geeksoncars.com/how_5835748_check-timing-car.html ? http://www.geeksoncars.com/how_5835748_check-timing-car.html ? http://www.geeksoncars.com/how_5835748_check-timing-car.html ? http://www.geeksoncars.com/how_5835748_check-timing-car.html ? http://auto.howstuffworks.com/timing-light.htm ? http://auto.howstuffworks.com/timing-light.htm ? http://www.geeksoncars.com/how_5835748_check-timing-car.html ? http://www.familyhandyman.com/automotive/car-maintenance/how-to-replace-spark-plugs/view-all ? http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-drive/culture/commuting/why-your-cars-engine-might-be-knocking-hint-its-not-the-oil/article11998780/ ? http://repairpal.com/engine-knocking","sourceUrl":"cars\\4 Ways to Stop a Car from Knocking - wikiHow.html"},{"id":20,"title":"4 Ways to Troubleshoot Low Water Pressure - wikiHow","body":"Edit Article How to Troubleshoot Low Water Pressure Four Methods:Checking Your Water PressureChecking PRV and Water Shut Off ValvesLocating A Water LeakTroubleshooting Hot Water Low PressureQuestions and Answers It is a legitimate concern when you notice low water pressure in your home or office. Low water pressure can be caused by many things. Simple problems like the shut-off valve being closed or a faucet being blocked can cause low water pressure. More serious issues like plumbing blockages or water leaks decrease water pressure, too. There are multiple causes to low water pressure, but there are many ways that you can troubleshoot this problem. There may be more than one cause to your problem, so it is a good idea to check multiple areas. Ad Steps Method 1 Checking Your Water Pressure 1 Determine if all locations within your home or office have low water pressure. Check various locations that have faucets. [1] The kitchen, the bathroom, basement and outdoor faucets, and hose hookups are common areas where fixture specific low water pressure can occur. Run water in all faucets and showers in your home to identify if there is are one or multiple problem problem areas or to determine that all locations have low water pressure. Run both hot and cold water through all faucets. If your water pressure is low only with hot water, the issue is likely your water heater. 2 Check the faucet if you only have low water pressure in a particular location. Your problem might only affect one or two locations. In this case, the source of the low water pressure is likely a clogged faucet or aerator. [2] Remove the end of the faucet. Examine your aerator. Check to make sure there are no debris or buildup. If the aerator needs to be cleaned, soak it in a water-vinegar solution. If that doesn\u0027t work, buy a replacement. These are very inexpensive.[3] Turn the water on before you replace the aerator. If the water flow is not restored to normal, the source of low water pressure is likely not the specific faucet but an overall problem. 3 Look for other sources of low water pressure. If you can\u0027t pinpoint the cause of your low water pressure to just one or two faucets in the house, its probably an overall problem. Check the PRV and water shut off valves in your home. This is often the cause of low water pressure. Look for water leaks. A leaking toilet or water main can cause low water pressure. Check your water heater. If you only have low water pressure when you are running hot water, it is likely due to your hot water shut-off valve on your water heater. Method 2 Checking PRV and Water Shut Off Valves 1 Look at the Pressure Reducing Valve (PRV). Shaped like a bell, the PRV is usually located on the line where it enters the home or office. Adjust it to see if it affects your overall water pressure. There will be a screw on the valve. To increase water pressure, tighten it by turning it clockwise. To decrease water pressure, loosen the adjusting screw by turning it counterclockwise. [4] Replacement may be necessary if the valve has failed or broken. These can be purchased at hardware or plumbing supply stores.[5] 2 Check the shut-off valve at the water meter. This valve can influence water pressure, even if it has been turned slightly.[6] Most homes and buildings have a master shut-off valve. This is located near the PRV valve or in a separate box near the water meter. This valve can shut off water to the entire home, and restrict flow if it is slightly closed. Turn the valve so it is completely open. 3 Test your water pressure again using multiple faucets. If the problem is resolved, the source was likely the PRV valve or water shut-off valve If you are still experiencing water pressure issues, you may have a water leak. Water leaks are a common source of low water pressure in a house. You should consult a plumber to fix a water leak or mineral buildup in your water lines. Method 3 Locating A Water Leak 1 Check the toilet in each bathroom. Running or leaking toilets are one of the most common source of water leaks in a home. This can cause very high water bills, so it is a good idea to determine if this is the root cause of a water pressure problem.[7] Start by removing the lid from the tank of the toilet. Put a few drops of food coloring or a dye tablet into the tank. Do not flush the toilet for at least one hour. If color has leaked into the bowl, your toilet has a leak. This can usually be fixed by replacing the toilet flapper or filling mechanism. 2 Check your service meter. This can help you determine if you have a service line leak.[8] Locate your service meter. Take a reading of the meter and check to see if the indicator gear is turning. The leak indicator can be a small triangle shaped dial or disk that rotates when water is flowing. If the leak indicator is turning, you likely have a leak. If it is not turning, it does not mean there isn\u0027t a leak. A slow leak may not register on the leak indicator. Don\u0027t run any water for 2 hours and do another service meter reading. If the numbers have changed you are losing water and have a leak Call your water company or a plumber to help you find the source of a leak and to arrange repairs. 3 Check for water spots in the basement and near water fixtures in the home. This can be a clear indication of a water leak.[9] In many cases you can hear a dripping sound in the case of a leaking faucet. Usually this requires a simple home repair. If there are large areas of water in the basement, there may be a water main leak. You should also check the ground in the area outside your home where your main meets the local supply. If the weather has been dry and the area around this junction is wet, there could be a leak at this spot. Contact your water company to resolve this issue. Method 4 Troubleshooting Hot Water Low Pressure 1 Inspect the water heater if your low water pressure only affects your hot water. In this case the water heater shut off valve is the most common source of this problem.[10] Verify the shut-off valve is completely open. For safety, each water heater includes a shut-off valve to use in case of emergencies. If the valve is shut even slightly, this can affect your water pressure. 2 Test your water faucets again to see if the problem is resolved. The water pressure issue should be resolved when hot water is run through a faucet. If the hot water low pressure problem is not resolved, it could be the water lines into the water heater or the appliance itself. In this case, call a plumber to troubleshoot further. 3 Contact your plumber to check your lines into your water heater. Blockages can occur within the lines, and plumbers have efficient ways of checking them.[11] The appliance itself may also be causing a problem. A licensed plumber will need to evaluate it to see if it needs to be replaced. Working with water heaters can be dangerous, so it is best to leave this job to a professional.

Call the water department to report the issue. Ask a plumber to check the water lines within your home or building. Older water lines sometimes become clogged or filled with mineral deposits. When this happens, replacement of your lines with copper or PVC piping to restore water pressure is necessary. Pay attention to when your water pressure fluctuates. Water pressure can decrease during times when more people on your line use water. Mornings and early evenings often account for peak usage times.

Whether you prefer the sporty look of a slightly lower stance, or a more dramatic drop in height, learning how to lower a car is a straight-forward process which requires manipulating the vehicle\u0027s suspension. We\u0027ll show you what it\u0027s all about. Ad Steps Method 1 For Leaf Springs 1 Alter your vehicle\u0027s leaf springs. Leaf springs consists of thin strips of spring steel banded and bolted together. 2 Remove the leaf springs from the rear suspension of the vehicle. Take them to a spring shop and have them de-arched, or use a reverse shackle. Another option is reversing the set up by placing the axle on top of the leaf spring, which is called a flip kit. This can be done by a home mechanic with common hand tools. To get even greater or increased drop, couple the flip kit with lowering blocks. These are available online or from your local auto parts store. They come in differing heights and will enable the vehicle to drop extremely low. They can be installed by a home mechanic. Depending on how low you go, you may have to install a C-notch above your real axle. The purpose of the notch is to give you a greater clearance between your frame and axle. Method 2 For Coil Springs 1 Manipulate your car\u0027s coil springs. Coil springs can be found on a car\u0027s front and/or back suspension, and are attached onto the A-frame or the axles. You can remove the stock coil springs and replace them with shorter springs, or take your springs to a spring shop and have the coils softened and shortened. 2 You can also cut the coils yourself. Use a grinder, cutting wheel, or torch to cut them. Start with cutting in quarter- or half-coil-turn increments, because cutting a coil is a permanent action. You may have to install shorter bump stops or cut your stock ones to fit. Method 3 Replace Springs 1 Replace the springs and shocks. Trade them out for adjustable airbag units available at a local auto supply store or from an online auto parts seller. In addition to installing the airbags to replace the springs, this method of lowering your car also requires installation of air lines, an air compressor, air reservoir tank and system activation switch. This process can be done at home. If you have rear leaf springs, you will need to get rid of them and replace them with a 4 link setup. This process usually needs a professional fabricator. Method 4 Hydraulic Cylinders 1 Replacing your car\u0027s springs with hydraulic cylinders. Hydraulics can be installed on 1, 2, 3 or all 4 suspension corners of your car. Installing a hydraulic system also requires installing an internal control system, hydraulic pumps and batteries to operate the pumps. One drawback to this method of lowering your vehicle is the large amount of battery power required to operate each hydraulic pump in the system. Method 5 Lower the Torsion Bar 1 Adjust your car\u0027s torsion bars down using the torsion bar key. This will sag your vehicle so it is lower to the ground. Torsion bars come factory equipped on vehicles and consists of a spring steel bar that\u0027s used in place of a coil or leaf spring. The torsion bar key is part of the torsion bar, which allows the vehicle ride height to be adjusted at the factory when the vehicle is built and as needed afterward. It\u0027s easily adjusted with a small hand wrench at home.

Tips If using the flip kit method, make sure to buy a flip kit that compensates for the pinion angle change when lowering your vehicle. An advantage to installing the airbag system is that the vehicle can be raised and lowered while moving or sitting still. This enables the vehicle to appear almost sitting on the ground while still being able to be raised to clear speed bumps and other obstacles that could potentially damage the undercarriage. Warnings In some locations, it may be illegal to adjust the stance of your vehicle while in motion. Changing suspension elements may void some vehicle warranties. If in doubt, check with your dealership, insurance agent or finance company before proceeding. Make sure to look, observe, and move any line or electrical wires that may get crushed when your lowered ride hits a gnarly bump. If you don\u0027t have a basic understanding on how suspension works, do not lower a vehicle yourself. Lowering a vehicle exposes it to road hazards which unaltered vehicles are typically positioned high enough to avoid. After lowering your vehicle many factors change and if you don\u0027t compensate for the changes, parts will break. Ex- if you don\u0027t compensate for pinion angle, then you will go through universal joints like no other. Replacing your springs with an airbag system requires a lot of fabrication, from removing the existing springs to plumbing the new air system and its components. Air bags also provide a rougher ride.

If the window suddenly stops moving at all, the problem could be as simple as a blown fuse or a loose connection. It is also possible that you have a faulty switch, especially if the window works on a hit and miss basis. Window motors go down sometimes as well. This is usually characterized by a gradual decrease in how well the window responds to the switch, but a slow window could also be getting stuck on the gaskets. Once you identify the problem, you may be able to repair it with some basic tools. Ad Steps Method 1 Changing a Fuse 1 Locate and open the fuse box. It should be located inside the car as a part of, or near, the dash. 2 Check your owner\u0027s manual to locate that operates the windows. It is not uncommon that the only thing wrong with electrical components in a vehicle is a blown fuse. If this is the case with your windows you will need to replace the window fuse.[1] 3 Pull the fuse straight out of its cradle. Be careful not to twist or otherwise force it. You do not want to damage the cradle or break a piece of the fuse off in the cradle. There are fuse tongs available at part supply stores that can help with this. 4 Locate a replacement fuse. It must be the rated for the same amperage as the original fuse that operated the window mechanism. The amp rating should be printed on the fuse, and it should also be listed in your owner’s manual. Do not use a fuse with a higher amp rating, as this may lead damaging the electrical components of your vehicle. 5 Push the new fuse straight down into the cradle. The fuse must be “set”. This means that it does not move or wobble. 6 Turn your car key to the \"on\" position. This provides power to your windows and allows you to test them. You need not start your car. 7 Test your windows. Confirm that they go up and down without restriction. Method 2 Repairing Window Gaskets 1 Evaluate the condition of your window seals and gaskets. You want your gaskets and seals in good repair. They are responsible for keeping rain out by forming a water tight boundary when your window is rolled up. They also serve to insulate the inside of the vehicle from road noise. 2 Check the entire gasket channel for foreign objects. Any obstruction of the channel may prevent the window from rising or falling properly. You should remove any objects such as pebbles or leaves before proceeding. 3 Clean the gasket with acetone. This will help to remove any grease or dirt build up that might impede your window or prevent your gaskets from sealing properly. Be very careful not to get any acetone on your car\u0027s paint or carpets. It\u0027s better to put a small amount on a cloth and wipe with the cloth than to pour the acetone directly on the gasket. 4 Repair any small tears. You can do this using a rubber adhesive or glue. Be sure to trim any loose corners with a razor blade so that you get a good seal. 5 Replace the gasket. This may be necessary if the original gasket has large tears or several small tears. Replacing the gasket is a fairly easy job. Use a trim removal tool to slide in between the window and and the gasket. Hook the tool underneath the gasket and pull up. Once the old gasket is removed, install the new gasket by fitting it into the same place as the original and pushing down firmly. 6 Lubricate the channel with silicone spray. This will help your window glide smoothly along the channel. 7 Retest the window. Your window should move up and down without restriction or delay if the problem has been fixed. Method 3 Fixing Wiring Problems 1 Find an electrical schematic of your vehicle. This can be found either from information in your owner\u0027s manual or on the Internet. 2 Trace the wiring from the fuse panel to the switch. You should refer to your electrical schematic for help. You want to make sure that there are no breaks in the connection from the fuse box to the switch. If you did not find a schematic, it might be easier to trace the wiring from the switch back to the fuse box to look for any breaks in the connection. 3 Use a multi-meter to confirm that the switch is getting 12V of power. Attach the leads of the multi-meter to where the electrical wires come into the switch and set the meter to D/C volts. It should read 12 volts. 4 Trace the wiring from the switch to the motor. This is the path that a signal will travel to move your window when you press the switch. Any breaks or loose connections in this path will prevent your motor from functioning properly. 5 Use the multi-meter to confirm that the motor is getting 12V of power. Attach the leads of the multi-meter to where the electrical wires come into the motor. Again, set it to D/C volts and it should read 12 volts. 6 Look for any interrupted voltage caused by a loose connector or corrosion. If there are any loose or corroded connections in the circuit they will disrupt the signal and cause your window to malfunction. 7 Fix the connector or corroded areas. Push any connectors or wiring harnesses together tightly, and clean any corrosion away with a wire brush or similar tool. . 8 Test the window again. If your problem was in the circuitry and is now fixed, then your window should freely roll up and down without any restrictions or delays. Method 4 Replacing a Faulty Switch 1 Locate the window switch panel. This is the button used to operate your window. It is almost always on the door, however, they are rarely found on the center console. 2 Remove the window switch panel. Be careful not to scratch up the door panel while removing the window switch, as it often requires prying. Using a shop rag or piece of cardboard under your prying tool can help. 3 Unplug the wiring connectors from the switch. You will need to test these connectors to make sure that they are providing the appropriate 12 volts to your switch. 4 Use your multi-meter to probe each connector. Set the multi-meter for D/C volts and put the prongs of your multi-meter into the connector. It should read 12 volts. 5 Check the wiring on any switch that has a low voltage reading. Tighten any loose connections, and clear away any corrosion. 6 Test another switch. Take a switch from another door and plug it into the connectors on the malfunctioning door. If you are able to operate your window using this switch, then the original is bad and will need to be replaced. 7 Buy a new switch. Contact your dealership or favorite parts store and get a new window switch. 8 Install the new window switch. This can be done by plugging the connectors into the switch and popping the switch back into the door panel. Method 5 Replacing Your Window Motor or Regulator 1 Remove the door panel. This task will vary from car to car, but typically you will have to remove some screws around the middle of the panel (such as inside the door pull) and then use a prying tool around the outside to pop out the clips on the perimeter.[2] Sometimes you may have to remove things such as weather-stripping or door moldings as well. 2 Use a multi-meter to make sure that the motor is getting the correct voltage. Attach the probes of your multi-meter to the motor’s plug and toggle the switch up and down.[3] Make note of the voltage in both directions. Your owner’s manual should list the specific voltage required. 3 Ensure that the window moves freely during this test. There should be no slow spots or blockages. 4 Unplug the motor. If you the motor is getting the proper voltage but not functioning properly, you likely need to replace it. Start by unplugging the wiring connectors from the motor. If your motor is functioning properly but the window is not responding, you may need to replace your regulator. 5 Remove the bolts that attach the regulator to the glass. The regulator is the lift assembly that moves your window up and down. You will have to move the window up or down to align these bolts with a hole in the door interior. Using an extension on a ratchet, you will put a socket (usually 8 or 10 mm) through the hole and loosen the two bolts. 6 Push the window all the way up. Use your hands to push the window up, and then either fasten it with tape or pull it out of the door altogether. 7 Unplug the wiring harness from the window motor. You will have to press down on the clip that holds the wiring harness into place and pull the harness out. These can be hard to press and sometimes it is best if you can get a screwdriver on it to press it in. 8 Unbolt the harness and/or motor from the door\u0027s interior. Any bolts holding the harness and motor will have to be removed. These can often be difficult to bolts to remove. You may need to use a ratchet with a long extension to provide the necessary angle to access and turn the bolts. 9 Pull the motor and harness out as one assembly. Once you have the assembly removed, you can separate the two pieces and replace the one that is malfunctioning. 10 Re-install the motor/regulator assembly. Once you have replaced the malfunctioning part, whether it was the motor or the regulator, it is time to slide the assembly back into the door\u0027s interior and bolt it back into it\u0027s original position. 11 Plug up the new motor. Plug the wiring harness into the window motor. This will provide power to the motor so use caution. 12 Lower your window back into its correct place on the wiring harness. Remove the tape or re-install your window. Make sure that the tabs in the bottom of the window are properly aligned to bolt it back onto the regulator. 13 Bolt the window to the regulator. Using the bolts you removed earlier and the same extension, you need to bolt your window back to the regulator. 14 Test your window. It should now move up and down freely when you press the switch.

Ask it here: Submit Video Tips If your window is stuck in the down position and you do not have time to repair it, you can push it up with or try to turn the motor manually to roll it up. This may require taking your interior door panel off, but once the window is up you can tape it in that position. Warnings If you must replace the window motor, proceed with extreme caution. The window motor has a lot of torque and can remove a finger if it is activated and your fingers are in the gears. To safely remove a window motor, the linkage arms should be secured in a vice before the springs and motor are removed.

Described below are the steps necessary for the disassembly, inspection, servicing, and reassembly of the unit. Included are general operating instructions and troubleshooting techniques necessary for proper performance. Ad Steps Method 1 SECTION A: OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS (LIFTING) 1 Secure the object being lifted. Ensure that the load that is to be lifted has been properly secured to prevent inadvertent movement during the lifting process. 2 Close the release valve, using the handle. Locate and close the release valve by turning it fully clockwise. Remove the handle from the handle sleeve. CAUTION! Do not over-tighten when closing the Release Valve as damage to the threads and seals may result. 3 Position the jack saddle. Center the saddle under the proper designated lift-point. 4 Raise the jack to lift the object at the point. Insert the handle into the handle sleeve and begin pumping the saddle up to the lift-point. 5 Re-verify the lift-point, saddle position, and proper base support for the jack itself to insure a safe lift. 6 Lift the load to it\u0027s desired height. Pump the Handle until the load reaches the desired lift height. 7 Transfer the load to the jack stand. Immediately transfer the lifted load to appropriately-rated jack stand(s). Method 2 SECTION B: OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS (LOWERING) 1 Raise the supported load. Raise the supported load just high enough to clear the jack stand(s). 2 Remove the jack stand.Remove the jack stand(s) carefully as to not come into contact with the jack. Use caution when working in and around the jack while supporting a load. 3 Lower the load to it\u0027s objective point. Using the handle, turn the release valve counter-clockwise NO MORE THAN 1/2-FULL TURN! 4 Remove the jack from the load. Once the load has been safely lowered, remove the jack and push the saddle to its fully-down position to reduce exposure of the hydraulic ram to contamination and corrosion. Method 3 SECTION C: MAINTENANCE (MODE) INSTRUCTIONS 1 Place the jack on a level work surface. Place the jack onto a clean, clutter-free, and LEVEL work surface prior to beginning any type of maintenance. 2 Remove the cylinder cover plate. Remove the center cover plate from the jack by gently pulling it straight upwards. The plate is simply pressed down onto the jack\u0027s frame, held in position by a supporting frame-pin that passes through the frame and a notch cut into the Plate. 3 Lower the cylinder., using the handle. Open the release valve to allow the saddle to descend to its fully-down position. 4 Perform a lubrication step. Periodically lubricate pivot points, axles, and hinges to insure safe and reliable performance of the unit, to prevent rust and corrosion, and assure that all wheels, casters, and pump assemblies move freely. 5 Perform a cleaning cycle periodically. Check the pump piston and ram for signs of rust or corrosion. Clean as needed with an oily cloth. WARNING! Never use any type of abrasive material to clean the machined surfaces of the pump piston or the cylinder ram! 6 Research how to store the floor jack. Store the jack with the pump piston, cylinder ram, and saddle in the fully-down position. Open the release valve (not more than 1/2-turn). This will help prevent rust and corrosion on these critical surfaces. Method 4 SECTION D: ADDING HYDRAULIC FLUID 1 Open the oil filler plug. Locate the oil filler plug located on top of the hydraulic reservoir (cylinder). Using a flat-head screwdriver gently pry the rubber-plug out of the reservoir (cylinder). NOTE: The oil filler plug is typically painted the same color as the jack essentially concealing it to make it appear as part of the reservoir assembly when in fact the plug itself is a rubber press-fitted seal. CAUTION! The hydraulic fluid located inside the reservoir could very well be under pressure when removing the plug. Insure that proper safety equipment is used when performing this step to prevent injury. Also, take necessary steps to prevent loss of the Plug should the pressure eject it from the port. 2 Add the hydraulic fluid. Begin adding hydraulic fluid into the reservoir until the fluid level is approximately 3/16\" from just covering the inner-cylinder as viewed from the oil filler plug hole. If too little or too much fluid is added, the jack will experience a wide-range of performance issues. Troubleshooting of the unit may be necessary and damage to the jack may occur if the issues are not properly resolved prior to use. 3 Bleed the hydraulic system of excess fluid, once the suitable amount of fluid has been added to the Reservoir. Refer to SECTION F: STEPS #02 - #07 to properly bleed the hydraulic system of any trapped air-pockets. Method 5 SECTION E: REMOVING HYDRAULIC FLUID 1 Open the oil filler plug. Locate the oil filler plug located on top of the hydraulic reservoir (cylinder). Using a flat-head screwdriver gently pry the rubber-plug out of the reservoir (Cylinder). NOTE: The oil filler plug is typically painted the same color as the jack essentially concealing it to make it appear as part of the reservoir assembly when in fact the plug itself is a rubber press-fitted seal. CAUTION! The hydraulic fluid located inside the reservoir could very well be under pressure when removing the plug. Insure that proper safety equipment is used when performing this step to prevent injury. Also, take necessary steps to prevent loss of the plug should the pressure eject it from the port. 2 Remove the hydraulic fluid. Fluid can be removed by simply tipping the jack onto its side allowing the fluid to drain from the reservoir into a suitable container. IMPORTANT: Dispose of hydraulic fluid (used or otherwise) in accordance with local regulations. IMPORTANT: Removal of any or all of the hydraulic fluid from the system may very well introduce air into the unit. Insure that the system is fully-bled prior to returning the jack to service. Method 6 SECTION F: BLEEDING THE HYDRAULIC SYSTEM 1 Bleed the hydraulic system. With the Oil Filler Plug still removed from the reservoir, use the handle to pump the jack 6 to 8 strokes to bleed any air that is trapped in the hydraulic system. 2 Replace the oil filler plug into the reservoir. Once the plug is in place again pump the jack 6 to 8 strokes to force additional trapped air up into the reservoir. 3 Remove the oil filler plug. Again, remove the oil filler plug to allow the forced air from the system to escape. CAUTION! The hydraulic fluid located inside the reservoir could very well be under pressure when removing the plug. Insure that proper safety equipment is used when performing this step to prevent injury. Also, take necessary steps to prevent loss of the Plug should the pressure eject it from the port. 4 Recheck the hydraulic fluid level in the reservoir to insure that it is at it\u0027s proper point. If additional fluid is required due to the evacuated air, refer to SECTION D: STEP #02 for the proper procedure. 5 Replace the oil filler plug into the reservoir. 6 Retest the hydraulic system. Pump the saddle to its fully-up position. If the saddle will not raise, or partially raise then repeat the steps in this section or refer to the troubleshooting checklist. If the saddle does raise to its designed height, repeat the steps in this section until no more air is heard escaping from the reservoir each time the Oil Filler Plug is removed.

You inhabit the inside of your vehicle whenever you drive, and it\u0027s good for both your health and peace of mind to keep your vehicle\u0027s interior clean. Luckily, cleaning your upholstery can be simple thanks to a variety of techniques and specific cleaning products tailored to vehicle upholstery. Ad Steps Method 1 Spot-Cleaning Stains 1 Test the stain remover before using. You don’t want the stain remover to ruin your upholstery, so be sure to test any stain remover first on an inconspicuous spot before using it. 2 Pretreat stubborn stains on leather. For stubborn stains on leather upholstery, pretreat the leather with a leather conditioner. Then apply a leather stain remover on the stain and rub it in. Allow it to sit for about 30 seconds and wipe off the stain remover. 3 Remove ink stains. For ink stains, use hairspray or rubbing alcohol mixed with water. Spray the hairspray on the stain and blot carefully with a damp, clean cloth to avoid spreading the ink or letting it run on the upholstery.[1] 4 Remove greasy and oily stains. For greasy or oily stains, such as lipstick or food grease, use a watered-down paint thinner formula and a cotton cloth. Put a little bit of paint thinner in a cup and add an equal amount of water. Dip a cotton cloth in the cup and rub it into the stain. Sprinkle the stain with salt or cornmeal and let it sit overnight. Vacuum this section of the upholstery.[2] Be sure to test the paint thinner on your upholstery to make sure it will not stain or ruin the material. 5 Remove coffee stains. If you happen to spill coffee, dilute the coffee with cold water and blot with a paper towel. Apply some glass cleaner and let it sit for 5 minutes. Blot again with a paper towel to lift up more of the stain.[3] Always blot stains. Never scrub them, so that they are not rubbed further in to your vehicle\u0027s upholstery. If the coffee is still visible, scrub the upholstery with dishwashing liquid and rinse with warm water. Blot the area again with paper towels. Dry the area with a hair dryer. Hold the hair dryer at least several inches away from the spot so that you don’t scorch the upholstery.[4] 6 Remove vomit stains. If someone gets carsick in your vehicle and vomits on the seat or the floor, clean it up as soon as possible to prevent it from setting into the upholstery. Wipe up excess vomit and dilute the stain with cold water. Wash the area with mild soap and warm water. Then neutralize the stain by pouring a small amount of club soda on a cloth and blotting it on the stain.[5], [6] Alternately, you can use a mixture paste of baking soda and water. The baking soda will also help to absorb the smell. 7 Remove blood stains. Blood can be a tough stain to remove. Do not use hot water or soap, as this will set the stain. Soak a cloth in cold water and blot it on the blood stain. Rinse the cloth in cold water and blot again until the stain lifts.[7] Method 2 Cleaning Fabric Upholstery 1 Use a homemade all-purpose upholstery cleaner. You don’t need to spend lots of money on commercial cleaners in order to clean your upholstery. Make your own cleaner with natural ingredients instead. Mix 1 part water with 1 part dishwashing liquid in a bucket or jug. Mix together and put into a spray bottle. Spray the mixture onto the upholstery, holding the bottle approximately 6-8 inches away. Rub the upholstery gently with a soft-bristled brush. Rinse the area with warm water by using a clean rag. Rinse out the rag frequently. Work on one seat or area at a time. Rinse each area thoroughly before moving onto the next area. Use a microfiber cloth to dry the area. 2 Use a mixture of soap, borax and hot water cleaner. To make another natural, non-caustic cleaner, grate a bar of soap (such as Ivory) until you have 6 tablespoons worth. Add this and 2 tablespoons of borax to a bucket. Slowly add 2 cups of boiling water. You can also add 10 drops of lavender essential oil for fragrance if you want. Allow this to cool and then whip it with a whisk until it is foamy.[8] Brush the foam onto your upholstery with a soft-bristled brush. Rinse the area with warm water by using a clean rag. Rinse out the rag frequently. Work on one seat or area at a time. Rinse each area thoroughly before moving onto the next area. 3 Use a commercial upholstery cleaner. These cleaners are readily available at home supply stores and are not very expensive. They do, however, tend to use harsher chemicals. Follow the instructions on the product’s label for proper usage. Apply the cleaner to your upholstery and use a brush to work it into the upholstery. Rinse with water thoroughly. 4 Rent a steam cleaner. Steam cleaners are available to rent at many grocery stores. These will deep clean upholstery and carpet by running hot water over the area that you’re cleaning and then sucking it back up immediately. This will extract the water from the upholstery along with dirt. Steam cleaners can cost $35-$40 for a 24-hour rental period. Follow the instructions to operate the steam cleaner correctly. You can purchase a commercial carpet/upholstery cleaner to use in this machine, or you can make a natural solution of 1 part white vinegar and 1 part water, with a few drops of lavender essential oil included.[9] Change the water in the steam cleaner often so that you’re not trying to clean the upholstery with dirty water. 5 Use a toothbrush to clean seams. On the seat upholstery, there are seams where the upholstery has been sewn together. Dirt and debris can easily gather here and it is often hard to lift this dirt with a vacuum or cloth. Use a toothbrush to get at these areas, scrubbing gently with your cleaner. 6 Clean the floor mats. Remove the floor mats from the car and clean them using the same cleaner that you’ve used on the rest of the upholstery. Rinse them thoroughly and dry them with a microfiber cloth. For rubber or vinyl mats, after you clean them, apply liquid wax shoe polish to them. This will help improve their shine and will also make them easier to rinse off and keep clean.[10] 7 Use a lint roller. A lint roller uses sticky paper to grab onto little pieces of fuzz, crumbs and hair. Remove hard-to-reach crumbs and hair from fabric upholstery by rolling a lint roller over the seats. Change the lint roller paper periodically to make sure that it’s sticky enough to pick up lint, fuzz, hair and dirt.[11] 8 Use a microfiber cloth to reduce lint transfer. When you’re blotting stains or wiping fabric upholstery, use a microfiber cloth that will not leave extra lint on the fabric.[12] Method 3 Cleaning Vinyl Upholstery 1 Use glass cleaner on vinyl upholstery. Vinyl seats are the easiest type of seats to clean, since spills and messes usually just wipe off. Spray an all-purpose glass cleaner on the seats and wipe them down with a soft cloth.[13] Work on one seat area at a time so that the glass cleaner doesn’t run down and drip onto the floor. 2 Use baking soda and water on vinyl upholstery. You can also use a mixture of baking soda and water to clean and polish vinyl seats. Make a paste of the two ingredients and rub it over the upholstery, one seat at a time. To finish the job, rinse the seats off with a mild soap and water mixture. Wipe the seats dry with a clean, soft cloth. Oil-based cleaners will harden your vinyl seats, so you should refrain from using these types.[14] 3 Use a toothbrush to clean seams. On the seat upholstery, there are seams where the upholstery has been sewn together. Dirt and debris can easily gather here and it is often hard to lift this dirt with a vacuum or cloth. Use a toothbrush to get at these areas, scrubbing gently with your cleaner. 4 Clean the floor mats. Remove the floor mats from the car and clean them using the same cleaner that you’ve used on the rest of the upholstery. To clean the mats, make an all-purpose upholstery cleaner by mixing 1 part water with 1 part dishwashing liquid. Spray the mixture onto the mat and brush with a soft-bristled brush. Rinse thoroughly with warm water and use a microfiber cloth to dry the mats. For rubber or vinyl mats, you can also apply liquid wax shoe polish to them. This will help improve their shine and will also make them easier to rinse off and keep clean.[15] Method 4 Cleaning Leather Upholstery 1 Use a leather-cleaning kit for leather seats. Leather requires more careful care than fabric or vinyl upholstery, as it is more susceptible to aging and fading. The best option to clean leather is to use cleaners specifically made for leather, such as cleaners and conditioners. These are often available as a kit, such as the Wolfgang Leather Care Cockpit Kit[16] or the Pinnacle Contours Interior Kit.[17] 2 Turn on your heater. Leather responds to heat and will accept cleaners and treatments more readily in a warm environment. If it’s hot where you live, then you don’t need to turn on the heater. But if it’s the middle of winter, turn on the heater for a few minutes to warm up the car before cleaning the leather.[18] 3 Pretreat stubborn stains on leather. For stubborn stains on leather upholstery, pretreat the leather with a leather conditioner. Then apply a leather stain remover on the stain and rub it in. Allow it to sit for about 30 seconds and wipe off the stain remover. 4 Use a leather cleaner. Apply the leather cleaner to your upholstery, focusing on one section or seat at a time. Use a soft cloth to rub the cleaner on the upholstery. Rinse off the cleaner thoroughly with clean water. Follow the instructions on the product’s label for proper usage. 5 Use a homemade mild cleaner. You can mix some mild hand soap with warm water and wash the leather upholstery. Do not use very much water. Be sure to thoroughly rinse off the soapy mixture by using a clean cloth soaked in water to wipe off the soap.[19] 6 Thoroughly dry the leather. After you’ve cleaned the leather, make sure it is completely dry before you apply conditioner. While leather naturally repels water, it will not hold the conditioner if it’s wet.[20] 7 Use a water-based, pH neutral leather conditioner. Leather conditioner will replenish the oils that make your leather smooth and rich-looking. Less expensive leather conditioners may be petroleum-based, which tend to cling to leather and can transfer to clothing. They may also leave a greasy finish on the leather. Using a water-based, pH neutral leather conditioner will ensure that your leather upholstery and your clothes are kept in good condition.[21] Apply the conditioner to a cloth and wipe over the leather. Wipe away any excess conditioner and allow it to sit for 15-20 minutes before using your car.[22] 8 Use a toothbrush to clean seams. On the seat upholstery, there are seams where the upholstery has been sewn together. Dirt and debris can easily gather here and it is often hard to lift this dirt with a vacuum or cloth. Use a toothbrush to get at these areas, scrubbing gently with your cleaner. 9 Clean the floor mats. Remove the floor mats from the car and clean them using the same cleaner that you’ve used on the rest of the upholstery. To clean the mats, make an all-purpose upholstery cleaner by mixing 1 part water with 1 part dishwashing liquid. Spray the mixture onto the mat and brush with a soft-bristled brush. Rinse thoroughly with warm water and use a microfiber cloth to dry the mats. For rubber or vinyl mats, you can also apply liquid wax shoe polish to them. This will help improve their shine and will also make them easier to rinse off and keep clean.[23] Method 5 Vacuuming Your Car 1 Use a wet/dry vacuum. A wet/dry vacuum such as a Shop-Vac is a powerful and handy machine that can handle different types of vacuuming jobs. They usually have a long hose or nozzle and a long cord, which makes it easier to vacuum out a car. Alternately, use a coin-operated vacuum at car wash. These also have long nozzles, but they require that you feed coins into a timed meter, which can interrupt your cleaning progress. There are small handheld, portable vacuums that you can also use. These are usually good for spot cleaning but do not tend to have enough suction power to adequately vacuum out a car. 2 Use plastic vacuum attachments. Most vacuums have plastic attachments, which are superior to metal attachments. With metal, you run the risk of scratching your car or upholstery, particularly if you have leather or vinyl seats.[24] Useful attachments are brushes with a wide square opening and a skinny, narrow attachment that can reach into crevices. 3 Move the seats. When vacuuming a vehicle, make sure you are getting into all the crevices and cracks to suck up dirt and dust. Recline the seats to get at the inside crease of the seat. Move the seats forward to get underneath the seats. Take out child car seats as well, so that you are sure to get underneath these, which tend to gather cereal, granola bars and crayons. 4 Take out floor mats. Vacuum the upholstery on the floor by getting underneath the floor mats. This will also make it easier to deep-clean the floor mats. 5 Vacuum frequently. Removing dirt and debris from your car will prevent them from becoming ground into the seats and the carpet, thereby contributing to hard-to-remove stains. Set a schedule for yourself to vacuum out your car at least once a month, or more frequently if your car gets dirty quickly. Method 6 Hiring a Professional Detailer 1 Locate an auto detailer. A detailer will completely clean your car, cleaning the upholstery, dashboards, vents, windows and other areas. Check with family and friends to find an auto detailer, or search online for one in your area. Make sure the detailer is certified or trained to use tools and cleaners properly. Also make sure they are insured. Call around to get an approximate price in order to compare detailers in your area. 2 Ask the detailer for a price quote. Take your car down to the detailer so they can see how big of a job it will be to clean the car. The detailer should not give you a price before they have seen your car, however. 3 Check the detailer’s work. Before you pay and leave, check to make sure the detailer has cleaned your car to your satisfaction.[25] If you have child car seats, make sure these have been removed and the seat underneath has been cleaned. 4 Ask the detailer about their cleaning products. Most detailers will likely use commercial cleaners and harsh chemicals to clean your car. If you prefer to stick with environmentally friendly cleaners, see if you can find a detailer who uses these kinds. Some detailers may try to cut costs by using cheaper cleaning products, which can ultimately be damaging or not as long-lasting as other products.[26] This may be particularly important if you have sensitivities to strong odors or chemical smells, which could potentially linger in the car. 5 Be ready to drop off your car. Detailing can take a minimum of two hours, and will likely take longer if you have several stains or an especially dirty car. Plan other errands to run in the area, or have someone pick you up so that you don’t have to wait around the detailer’s garage. Method 7 Preventing Future Messes 1 Get car seat covers. Purchase seat covers that will protect your seats. These can either match your seats or they can have bright, colorful patterns on them. They are available for both bucket seats (such as front seats) and for bench seats (such as backseats), and can cost $30-$40. Many kinds can be machine-washed, making it easier to tidy up your car.[27] 2 Apply a stain repellent to your upholstery. A stain repellent will make it hard for stains to settle into the upholstery and will prolong the life of the upholstery. A stain repellent like Scotchgard Fabric and Upholstery Protector is available at home supply stores. Follow the instructions on the product label for proper usage. 3 Clean spills and messes immediately. Don’t allow spills and messes to sit in your car if possible. If they are not cleaned up right away, they may set into the upholstery, making it hard to remove them. Additionally, they can add to an unpleasant odor in your car. 4 Limit food and drinks in the car. By banning food and drinks in the car, you can reduce the potential for many stains and messes. Accidents are sure to happen if you stop suddenly or you are trying to eat while driving. Eliminate this risk by not allowing food or drinks in the car. 5 Keep your car tidy. By removing garbage and other items from your vehicle after each journey, you may reduce the potential for stains to occur from grease-soaked fast food bags or spilled coffee cups. Dispose of any excess trash immediately after use so it doesn’t pile up and add to the clutter of your vehicle\u0027s interior. Remove crayons and other things that are prone to melting if it is hot outside. The temperature of your car’s interior will be markedly hotter than outside and crayons, for example, will melt on upholstery if left there in the heat. 6 Vacuum regularly. Removing dirt and debris from your car will prevent them from grinding into the seats and the carpet, thereby contributing to hard-to-remove stains. Set a schedule for yourself to vacuum out your car at least once a month, or more frequently if your car gets dirty quickly.

Unlike the “regular” (hydraulic) brake system on most vehicles, the parking brake is a purely mechanical system. It is operated by springs and cables inside a sheath. Water can become trapped in the sheath and freeze solid if it is cold enough. This ice prevents the cable from sliding inside the sheath as designed. Ad Steps Method 1 Dislodging Ice 1 Start the vehicle. Turn the key and start your vehicle. This will start warming up all of the car\u0027s components via heat from the engine and exhaust. It usually takes around ten minutes for the engine to warm up, but that does depend on the outside temperature.[1] Revving the engine will speed up the process. 2 Release and set the parking brake repeatedly. This is the easiest way to dislodge ice from your parking brake.[2] It also has the added benefit of not requiring that you get out in the cold. If you have given your car time to heat up as suggested above, and tried five or ten times to release the brake without success, you should consider trying to tap the ice off of the brake. 3 Tap the parking brake lightly. Consult your service manual to see which wheels the parking brake holds. Try gently tapping the brake drum or caliper with a hammer or mallet to dislodge any ice. You can put cardboard or a block of wood between the hammer and your bake components, though this is not necessary. You can also try gently wiggling the brake cable in an attempt to dislodge ice. Method 2 Melting Ice 1 Locate an appropriate heat source. A heat gun or hair dryer will usually work, but you may have to run an extension cord out to your vehicle. Another option is to use hot water, but be conscious of the current temperature. If it is still below freezing, you should not use water as it may refreeze. 2 Apply heat to the brake components. Look at your service manual to see which wheels the parking brake holds. Then use your heat source to apply heat to the brake cable and the calipers/drums at that wheel. You should apply the heat long enough for the brake components to be warm to the touch. The amount of time this takes will vary based on how cold it is outside. This will have to be done from underneath the vehicle so you may need to lift your car. For safety reasons, you should turn off your engine and chock your wheels before getting under the car. 3 Try to release your brake. After applying heat to the brake system, immediately try to release the brake. Do not give the braking components time to refreeze. Method 3 Melting Ice with Engine Heat 1 Roll all of your windows down. You will be blocking off the spaces under the car, and running the risk of putting excess carbon monoxide into your car. You should roll your windows down and turn your fan on high to allow circulation. 2 Create a “tunnel” underneath the car. Shovel Snow or arrange other materials along the sides of the vehicle to block as much of the open space between the ground and sides of the vehicle as possible. The objective is to give the heat created by the engine a path to the rear of the vehicle where most of the parking brake components are located. 3 Allow the vehicle to warm up. Wait outside the vehicle while it is running. You want to allow the engine time to warm up and produce the heat necessary to melt any ice underneath the car. 4 Attempt to release the brake again. If still frozen, allow more time for thawing and/or block open spaces at the front and rear of the vehicle, too (this is particularly helpful if it is gusty or windy). Pushing down the accelerator slightly will increase heat by working the engine harder. Leave your door open while pressing the accelerator and then get back out of the car. If you have any exhaust issues at all, or have the exhaust blocked off, you run the risk of filling the car with carbon monoxide. This can be deadly. 5 Take down your “tunnel.\" Once the ice has thawed, you can remove the walls that you created to block the underside the car. 6 Allow the cab to ventilate before driving. Leave your windows down and your fan on high and allow the cab to displace any possible carbon monoxide buildup before sitting in the cab or driving. Again, carbon monoxide is deadly. Method 4 Preparing to Replace a Defective Brake Cable 1 Purchase a replacement cable from a local parts dealer. Park brake cables sometimes become corroded or get dirt and grim in them. If this happens, it can cause your brake to get stuck and not function properly. Your best option is to replace the cable. 2 Pull the car onto level, solid ground. It is important that your car does not sink or roll away while resting on a jack or on jack stands. 3 Remove hubcaps from the wheels you will be working on. Consult your service manual to see which wheels are held by the park brake. If any of the wheels you will be working on has hubcaps, use a wrench or screwdriver to remove them. 4 Loosen the lug nuts with a lug wrench (tire iron) or impact wrench. It is important to remember to loosen, or break, the lug nuts before you jack up the vehicle. This way the weight of the vehicle is still on the wheels and it prevents them from spinning dangerously while you turn the lugs. 5 Jack up the car. Once the lugs have been loosened, it will be necessary to jack the car up so that the wheels can be removed. As mentioned above, this should be done on level concrete or some other hard, level surface. Some important things to remember when jacking up the car are: Your owner’s manual will recommend jacking points The most common way to elevate the car is a floor jack or trolley jack. You should use jack stands to stabilize the car. If you have access to a hydraulic lift, it will save you time. 6 Remove the wheels. At this point, the lugs may be loose enough to remove by hand. If not, finish removing the lugs with the lug wrench or impact wrench. Once the lugs are removed, pull the wheel off of the wheelbase. Place wheels under the car as back-up protection in case the jack stands fail. 7 Remove the grease dust cap. This cap will be in the center of the hub and can be removed by simply prying away from the hub. This will expose the retaining nut.[3] 8 Pull out the cotter pin. There will be a pin in front of the retaining nut that prevents the nut from loosening (referred to as a cotter pin). Remove it by straightening the bent end of the pin and prying it out of its hole with pliers or a screwdriver.[4] 9 Remove the retaining nut. Using a wrench or ratchet, turn the nut counter-clockwise (to the left) to loosen it. If the nut is stuck, lubricate it with WD-40 or similar lubricant. 10 Inspect the drum. Some drums have small bolts holding them to the hub. If this is the case, you will need to remove those bolts. [5] 11 Attempt remove the drum. Pull the drum straight off of the hub. You may have to wiggle a little to get it started. If the drum appears stuck and will not pull off, you should: Check to make sure all bolts holding the drum to the hub are removed. Check to see if the drum is getting caught on the brake shoes.[6] 12 Retract the brake shoes. This step is only necessary if your drum is getting caught on the brake shoes. You will need to look on the back side of the backing plate (the steel plate on which the brake components are mounted) for a small rubber plug. Removing this plug will provide access to the brake shoe adjuster. Use a flat head screwdriver or a brake adjuster bar to retract the brake shoes. The adjuster is designed to self-adjust the shoes into a tightened position, so loosening them may be tricky. If the drum gets harder to turn as you adjust, you are going in the wrong direction. Once the shoes are retracted, you can remove the drum and continue. Method 5 Removing the Cable 1 Remove the return springs. These springs attach to the brake shoe and the shoe anchor and hold tension on the brake shoe. Once the brake pedal is released, they return the brake shoe to its original position. To remove them, use the round part of the brake tool with a little notch. Place the round part on the anchor pin (the nob that the springs are hooked to) and turn it until the notch catches the spring, and then twist and pull to remove the spring.[7] 2 Remove the retaining rings that hold the brake shoes in place. To do this, lightly grip the outside of the retaining ring with pliers, push in, and twist until the ring comes off.[8] 3 Pull the brake shoe off. At this point the shoe should easily pull away from the backing plate. There will be another spring attached at the bottom of the shoe, but it will no longer be tensioned so you can just slide it off of the shoe. 4 Remove the emergency brake line. One of the brake shoes will be connected to an emergency brake line. To remove it, pull the spring cover back and slide the cable sideways away from the shoe.[9] 5 Slide the emergency brake line out of the backing plate. There will be a hole in the backing plate where the emergency brake line comes in from under the car. Use a flat screwdriver to depress the tabs on the brake cable that hold it in the backing plate and then pull it through the hole. 6 Follow the length of the cable back to the brake lever. Whether your brake is operated by a hand lever or a foot pedal, it will connect to the brake cable. Once you find this connection, use a flathead screwdriver to release the cable from its clip. Now that the cable is loose on both ends, you are ready to install your new cable. Method 6 Installing the New Cable 1 Grease the new cable. It is important to lubricate the cable before installation to ensure that it works properly. 2 Connect the new cable to the park brake lever. Connect the front end of your new cable to the lever assembly by sliding it into the same clip that held the old cable. 3 Run the cable to the backing plate. Be sure to fasten the cable to the body of the vehicle whenever called for in your service manual. You want to keep the correct amount of tension on the cable at all times to ensure that it functions properly. Slide the cable into the hole in your backing plate. 4 Connect the new brake line to your brake shoes. Fasten the emergency brake cable to the brake shoe on the same side you removed it. To do this, pull up the cover and slide the cable into the proper slot on the shoe (it will look the same as the one you removed from it).[10] 5 Grease the backing plate. You want to avoid squeaking and rubbing of the brake shoes. For this reason, you should grease any bare or rubbed spots on the backing plate.[11] 6 Slide the bottom spring onto the brake shoe. There will be a hook at the end of the spring and a slot in the bottom of the brake shoe. Hook the spring into that slot. 7 Slide the shoe into place against the backing plate. Now it is time to put the first brake shoe back into place. Once you get it lined up, hold it there until you can replace the retaining ring. Method 7 Putting it All Back Together 1 Replace the retaining ring for the first shoe. Put the spring that goes with the retaining ring in place over the small rod that protrudes from behind the brake shoe. Place the ring over the spring, press in and twist until the ring slides over the rod and locks into place. 2 Slide the bottom spring onto the second brake shoe. Now, it is time to begin installing the second brake shoe. Again, you are going to start with the bottom spring. 3 Put the brake shoe into its proper place against the backing plate. You will need to line it up with the adjusting spring lever. 4 Fasten the adjusting spring onto the second brake shoe. Use the flat end of your brake spring tool to pry the spring into place and hook it at the top of the second brake shoe. This will connect the two brake shoes. 5 Replace the retaining ring for the second shoe. Follow the same procedure as you did with the first retaining ring. Place the spring first, then push and twist the ring into place. 6 Use two screwdrivers to set the adjusting screw. This screw changes the position of the adjusting spring, which in turn changes the position of the brake shoes. Since the new shoes are thicker than the old ones, you will need to set the adjusting screw to account for that. Use one screwdriver to push the automatic adjuster assembly down and the other to twist the cog that loosens the adjuster. 7 Put the drum back on. Slide the drum back onto the hub. You will want to spin it and make sure that it has just a little drag. If the drum does not spin then your shoes are too tight and you need to loosen them (using the adjusting screw). If the drum spins freely with no drag at all then your shoes are too loose and you will need to tighten them (using the adjusting screw). 8 Replace any bolts that hold the drum to the hub. You may or may not have bolts to fasten your drum to the hub. If you do, they should be reinstalled now. 9 Reinstall the retaining nut and cotter pin. You want to tighten the retaining nut that holds the drum in place, and also put the cotter pin back through the hole to keep the nut from loosening. 10 Put the dust cap back on. The dust cap should push right back into place. Make sure that it is snapped back into place tightly. 11 Re-install the wheels. You should slide the wheels back onto the wheelbase and thread the lug nuts on tight enough to hold wheels in place while the car is still on the jack stands. 12 Remove the jack stands and lower the vehicle to the ground using the floor jack. Do this slowly and carefully. You do not want the vehicle to drop suddenly. 13 Tighten the lugs to the specified torque. Once the weight is back on the wheels, use a lug wrench or impact wrench to tighten the lugs to the proper torque specifications in your service manual. 14 Add brake fluid if needed. You should check your brake fluid and add more if needed anytime you do brake work. 15 Test the brake. Before you drive or park your car, you want to be sure that your park brake is working properly. Set the park brake and put the car into drive. The brake should hold the car still, or at the very least provide resistance. Release the brake and make sure that the resistance is gone.

Ask it here: Submit Tips If the temperature is going to be below 32°F (0°C) for extended periods of time, it may be advisable to avoid using the parking brake if this can be done safely. When parking the vehicle, leave a standard transmission in gear and an automatic transmission in park. Turn wheels towards the curb if parked pointing downhill or away from the curb if pointing uphill so that the car’s front wheel rests against the curb. Warnings Minimize time spent inside the car while running. With the spaces under the vehicle blocked off, any exhaust leaks in the engine compartment or along the exhaust system can more easily work their way into the cabin—potentially causing carbon monoxide poisoning. Before entering the car, after it has been idle for several minutes, make sure that the cabin is ventilated to remove any build-up of exhaust fumes. Carbon monoxide is colorless and odorless, and inhaling it can be fatal. Make sure that the end of the exhaust pipe is not obstructed in any way, and that the exhaust gases from it cannot become trapped under the vehicle.

It produces a richer fuel/air mixture when the engine is cold, then gradually makes the fuel mixture leaner as the engine warms up. This is accomplished by a butterfly valve in the throat of the carburetor, at the very top. When this valve is closed the flow of air is very much reduced and the fuel/air mixture is rich. When the valve is open the flow of air is maximized and the fuel/air mixture should be correct for a warm engine.. Ad Steps 1 The engine must be cold to make this adjustment. 2 Remove the air cleaner. 3 Find the automatic choke. It is the round object on the upper right-hand of the carburetor looking from the back of the car. There is a wire coming to it from the positive side of the coil. Check this with a trouble light for voltage when the key is on. The choke is held in position by a triangular ring clamp and three screws so it can be loosened and rotated for adjustment. 4 Pull the throttle arm on the left side of the carburetor down to free the cam (little step arm) that the screw at the top of the throttle lever rests on. With the engine cold, the butterfly valve should be closed. As the engine warms up, the coil voltage heats an element inside the automatic choke, causing a bi-metal spring to uncoil, opening the butterfly valve, and moves the cam to reduce the idle speed. 5 Release the throttle arm so that the return spring snaps it back. When cold, the little screw at the top of the throttle arm should now rest on the top step of the stepped cam. This sets the hi-idle, which is needed together with the choke on a cold engine to provide sufficient idle speed to keep the engine running until it warms up fully. 6 When cold loosen (not remove) the three screws on the right side that hold the choke in place. 7 Keep your eye on the butterfly valve in the carburetor throat. Turn the choke element clockwise until the butterfly is standing straight up. Then turn the choke counterclockwise until the choke butterfly fully closes (not too tight). 8 Tighten the three screws that hold the choke in place. 9 Start the engine with the air cleaner off. As the engine warms up, make sure that the butterfly opens until it is standing fully open when the engine is fully warm. If it doesn\u0027t fully open,put your finger briefly on the ceramic of the automatic choke and see if it is hot. If not- you need a new one. Try it again in the morning and see if it opens enough to drive it. Check that it is wide open when warm. Re-adjust until you get it right. 10 http://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title\u003dAdjust-the-Automatic-Choke-on-an-Aircooled-Volkswagen-%28VW%29-Beetle\u0026action\u003dedit#he Reader Questions and Answers Unanswered Questions Show more unanswered questions Add New Question Answered Questions Don\u0027t see your question?

Your timing must be at the correct setting for your car to perform at top level, affecting the speed and efficiency at which the engine fires. You can adjust your car\u0027s timing with a timing light and a set of wrenches, tools available at any auto parts store. Ad Steps Part 1 Understanding Ignition Timing 1 Learn if your car needs to be adjusted or not. Modern cars that are controlled by electronic ignitions don\u0027t need to have their timing adjusted, but old-style 4-stroke engines require that the timing be adjusted periodically to optimize the efficiency of the engine, making sure that the spark fires at the appropriate moment in the ignition cycle. If you hear telltale signs of the timing of your car not being quite right, such as pinging, backfiring, or if the car runs too rich or too lean, you will need to either take it to a mechanic or adjust the timing yourself. 2 Understand the ignition cycle. The four \"strokes\" in the 4-cycle engine refer to the process of intake, compression, power, and exhaust. The timing of the ignition refers to the point between the compression and the power strokes at which the spark plug fires, creating the combustion that results in your horsepower, forcing the piston down into the cylinder.[1] When the piston comes up during the compression stroke, just before the piston gets to the top of its compression stroke (which is called \"top dead center\"), the spark plug should fire. Over time, this tends to get misaligned somewhat, resulting in a less-than-optimum spark plug firing time. The distance before the \"top dead\" center is the ignition timing, and it\u0027s represented by a row of graded numbers on the balancer or flywheel through an access hole. 3 Learn the ignition timing number. Look for the ruler-style row of numbers on the front of the engine\u0027s harmonic balancer (or flywheel), which should have numbers above and below zero. Typically, when your car comes from the manufacturer, ignition base idle timing is set to a manufacture specification before top dead center. The timing advances as the engine\u0027s speed accelerates, however, resulting in a variable that will need to be periodically adjusted using a timing light. Numbers to the left of zero on the timing tape refer to the piston as it travels down, while numbers to the right of zero refer to the piston\u0027s upward motion. Moving the wheel right is called \"advancing\" the timing, while moving the wheel left is \"moving back\" the timing. Part 2 Checking Your Timing 1 Hook up your timing light or timing gun. Hook your timing gun up to the power and ground terminals on your car\u0027s battery, and hook the sensor that accompanies the timing gun to your number one cylinder spark plug wire. Follow the instructions particular to the timing light you\u0027re using to hook it up properly. The \"gun\" works by illuminating the timing marks in a strobe fashion as it spins, allowing you to see the point at which the spark plug is firing on the timing index. When the spark plug fires, the sensor sends a signal to the light, which strobes in the gun, illuminating the numbers at the proper moment. 2 Have a helper rev the engine. To check your timing number and see how it is firing, have someone rev the engine while you illuminate the timing numbers with your light. You obviously want to make sure the car is in park, and keep your hands a safe distance from the engine as it revs. 3 Shine the light directly onto the harmonic balancer and find the number. Though the wheel is turning, the light should seem to \"freeze\" it at a particular number. This is the timing number. Note the number of degrees to the right or left of zero. As the RPMs increase, the point at which the spark plug is firing should also increase somewhat. This is normal, because ignition works on a curve, allowing for the speed increase and adjusting the timing accordingly. To check for total timing, you want to be sure to rev the engine to at least 3500 RPMs. This will allow you to make sure the curve of the ignition timing is being set, as well as the initial timing. 4 Account for vacuum timing, if necessary. If your car features vacuum timing advance in addition to mechanical timing, and you\u0027ll need to loosen the distributor adjustment bolt before you start the engine. Next, remove the vacuum advance hose from the carburetor and plug it with a rag to check your timing. Vacuum timing works by making minor adjustments at at low RPM by rotating slightly to adjust for the timing. 5 Adjust the timing, if necessary. Now that you\u0027ve found your ignition timing number, how do you know if you need to adjust it? All models of cars will have differing timing values, depending on the year it was manufactured and the variety of transmission used. To learn whether or not you need to adjust your timing, find the optimum timing number for your make and model and adjust if necessary. If you don\u0027t know your timing number, talk to a licensed mechanic or employee at your local auto parts store to consult their manuals and find the proper timing number. Part 3 Adjusting the Timing 1 Loosen the bolt that secures the engine\u0027s distributor enough so that the distributor can be turned. To adjust your timing, all you need to do is turn the distributor housing one direction or the other, depending on whether or not you want to advance or move back the timing. If the rotor turns clockwise, you\u0027ll advance the timing by rotating the distributor counterclockwise, and vice versa. It\u0027ll take some touch to get it right, so it helps to have someone to rev the engine, check the number, and twist the distributor. 2 Adjust while the engine is at idle speed. Grab the distributor firmly and rotate it slowly to one side or the other. Continue rotating until the timing mark is in the correct position. Align the timing marks by continuing to move the distributor and checking with your timing light. When you\u0027ve got it set where you want it, lock it back down by tightening the distributor bolts.[2] Reconnect vacuum hoses. 3 When in doubt, total timing should be somewhere between 34 and 36 degrees. A typical small-block Chevy\u0027s timing curve needs to be set somewhere in this range for maximum performance, when the engine is being revved at 3500 RPM. At this point, the timing should stop advancing and should remain steady.[3] Total timing minus your base timing number should meet your engine specification for total advance degrees. If the number is not as specified then you may have a distributor mechanical advance problem. 4 Tighten the distributor bolt when you are satisfied the timing is set correctly.

Ad Steps Method 1 Preparation 1 Find a suitable place to perform the work. You will need a place with excellent ventilation, minimal dust, good lighting, electricity, and lots of room to work around the vehicle. Residential garages are not usually suitable because of the presence of water heaters or furnaces that may cause ignition of paint fumes which can accumulate during the painting process. 2 Gather the materials and equipment you will need to do the job. See \"Things You\u0027ll Need\" for a complete list, but here is a general outline: Painting equipment Paint Sanding and polishing tools and supplies Safety equipment 3 Remove rust and repair any dents you do not want to be visible when the painting is complete. 4 Remove any chrome or plastic trim which can be taken off easily and replace later. Much of the body panel moldings used on cars can be snapped off and snapped back on easily, but if a gentle attempt to remove it is not successful, do not try to force it off. Some stores sell tools that aid in the process of removing trim. 5 Sand the paint either to the bare metal, the original primer, or at least sufficiently for the new paint to adhere to. How much you choose to sand is up to you, but the best results will require removing the paint down to bare metal, re-priming the surface with an automotive primer, and then applying your finish paint. 6 Clean all surfaces thoroughly, using mineral spirits or denatured alcohol to make sure no oils (including body oils from fingers and hands) are on the car. 7 Use masking tape and paper to cover all surfaces not to be painted, including glass, window trim, door handles, mirrors, and grills. Make sure that there are no holes in the masking tape and paper that will allow overspray to get through. Covering your garage with plastic is also a good idea to avoid permanently coloring the room Method 2 Painting the Car 1 Prime the surface with a corrosion resistant, self-etching primer if you have removed all paint down to bare metal. Prime any surface you used body filler or removed rust from, feathering these areas to a smooth transition and applying enough paint to fill scratches or pits left in the preparation process. 2 Allow the primer to cure thoroughly. Check the information on the container. Primer curing times may differ, and some primers require recoating (applying finish paint) in a certain time period after application. 3 Sand all primed surfaces smooth. Use a 600 grit wet/dry paper to smooth paint runs or drips smooth to the surface, being careful not to sand too far and exposing the metal again. 4 Clean the surface after priming to remove any dust or oil that has accumulated during priming. Wipe it using a wax and grease remover or acetone. 5 Spray the finish paint on the car. Prepare the paint for spraying according to manufacturer\u0027s directions. Automotive enamels and some polyurethanes give better results with a hardener or catalyst. Make sure the paint is thinned correctly for the equipment you are using, but avoid over-thinning, which will decrease the gloss of the finished surface and can cause runs. 6 Allow the paint to fully cure. When using a catalyst, your paint should be dry to touch in less than 24 hours with full cure taking as long as 7 days depending of the product. During the interval between beginning the painting process and tack free time, the car must remain free of dust. 7 Finish sanding the car. Use 1200 or finer grit wet sandpaper, and sand the finish coat of paint until it is perfectly smooth. Rinse any sanding residue from the surface and allow it to dry. Clear-Coat may be used if desired to give a deeper, higher gloss look. Clear-Coat may be sanded with 1500 grit wet sandpaper to remove small runs, dirt, and other minor imperfections. 8 Use a rubbing compound to polish the paint and begin to bring out a gloss. This step is best accomplished by hand, but buffing machines and power polishers are available that can make it much easier. Be cautious, as they can ruin a paint job if misused. It may be a good idea when using a machine to tape off the edges and buff them by hand.

See Step 1 for more information. Ad Steps Method 1 Improving Performance 1 Reduce the weight of the car. One of the easiest things that you can do right now to increase the horsepower is to make your vehicle as light as possible, which allows your vehicle accelerate better. Remove unnecessary clutter from your car, and strip it down as much as possible for optimum performance. 2 Upgrade to a free-flowing exhaust system. Upgrading to a high-performance exhaust system can increase your horsepower by a measure of five to 10 on some natural aspiration vehicles, while vehicles with an additional supercharger can pick up much more. It\u0027s a common misconception that oversized piping negatively affects back pressure, resulting in a loss of low-end torque and power. In truth, most engines prefer the most free-flowing system, in terms of intake, header and exhaust. 3 Use test piping. Research \"cat-back\" systems for purchase, also sometimes called \"test piping.\" These systems run from your catalytic converter to the end of the exhaust piping, increasing horsepower. The installation kit is generally several hundred dollars, but you could save on the price by shopping around and doing it yourself. Measure the diameter of the pipe that comes out of your catalytic converter, and replace with larger exhaust piping. You can pay to have this installed at the shop, or you can do it yourself by cutting the old exhaust piping and leaving a few inches to weld onto. If you do, position the new system in place and weld or clamp it to the spot you just cut. Reinstall the hangers that you removed. 4 Upgrade to a free-flow aftermarket air filter. It\u0027s also a good idea to buy a free-flow air filter that fits your car and install it to slightly increase your HP. It\u0027s not a big change, but it\u0027s a good way to ensure that your vehicle is performing at the highest-possible level. Open the hood, locate the air filter housing, and remove it. Unscrew clamps or screws, taking care to avoid getting any contaminants into the filter housing. Remove and discard the old air filter. Clean the inside of the box with a damp cloth and insert your new, free-flow filter. Be aware the many aftermarket air filters will actually allow greater particulate matter to pass into the engine and oil filters, especially if improperly maintained, and will also spray oil into the intake. The oil from the filter can damage or destroy the mass air flow (MAF) sensor on vehicles so equipped. In forced-induction engines the marginal benefit of increased air flow with an aftermarket filter is generally outweighed by the fact that the turbo will supply the requested air regardless of the filter used, and greatly increased reliability from not having oil and sand in the intake and on the MAF. 5 Research turbocharge and supercharge options. Installing a supercharger in a large-block engine, or a turbocharger in a smaller-block, will basically involve completely rebuilding your engine and upgrading the stress-bearing components of the engine, which will cost several thousands of dollars. It\u0027s a huge project, but is the most effective way to increase the horsepower of your vehicle.[1] If you\u0027re committed to installing a supercharger in your car, you might consider the following varieties: Root superchargers are the oldest type of supercharger system, usually among the cheapest, are and quite popular among racing vehicles. They work by funneling extremely large quantities of air through the intake manifold, providing quick bursts of energy. Twin screw superchargers pull air through lobes, which becomes trapped in the rotor housing and becomes compressed in a cone-shaped tapering device. Not legal in all states, these superchargers tend to be extremely loud. Centrifugal superchargers make use of a powered impeller to pull high-pressure air into a compressor, reaching upward of 60,000 RPM easily, making them the most efficient supercharger for your vehicle. Method 2 Reflashing Your Car\u0027s Computer 1 Enhance a turbocharged engine with a programmer. These devices modify the programming on your vehicle\u0027s computer, called \"reflashing,\" to allow for more horsepower, torque, and sometimes better fuel economy. On a naturally-aspirated engine, the horsepower increase will be quite minor, but with a supercharger you can see huge gains in HP. Some auto shops will advertise flashing options, saving you lots of money in the process. In practical terms, it\u0027s not something people often do themselves, so you might talk with a mechanic you trust about it if you\u0027re interested.[2] 2 Enhance supercharged engine\u0027s computer with a power module. Aftermarket power modules can be used in a similar way, sometimes offering up to 30 extra HP with proper installation. To install, look in the driver\u0027s manual, a Chilton or a Haynes guide to see how to access the car\u0027s computer, then disconnect negative battery cable and unplug the wiring harness from the computer. Plug in an aftermarket power module. Insert it between the wiring harness and the computer. Reconnect negative battery cable. 3 Weigh the pros and cons. On the upside, re-flashing the computer in your car can be a great and efficient way of upping the horsepower, giving you a powerful ride. On the downside, it\u0027s an expensive process that requires you already have a supercharged engine — another expensive process. Many performance modifications to an engine can also decrease its fuel economy, and reflashing also generally voids any warranty on a vehicle you\u0027ve purchased. Know that if you choose to complete the process, it\u0027s on you. Reader Questions and Answers Unanswered Questions Can I change the pump rotor to increase speed?

When testing your car after upgrading, take it to a safe sanctioned race track, if possible. Race tracks are not only safer, but give you a record of how fast your car really is, and how much your performance has improved when making comparison runs. Many modern cars have snorkels on the airbox intake placed at a high pressure point in the front of the vehicle to intake cooler outside air. If one chooses to install an aftermarket cold air intake (CAI) attention should be paid to the current setup. Furthermore, be aware that low-mounted CAI installs have a greater chance of sucking up water in rainy weather causing hydrolock and major engine damage. Warnings Certain states, such as California, require each aftermarket performance part to pass a certification for use on a street vehicle (CARB, or California Air Resources Board). If your upgrades don’t have this sticker, your vehicle can be impounded. Check with your local licensing agency about emissions regulations.

However, there are a few other secondary purchases that consumer advocate groups, government agencies and insurance companies all recommend for safe driving and for the longevity of your vehicle. For those who want to outfit their car or truck the right way, here are some of the most popular recommendations for how to buy the basics for your car. Ad Steps 1 Purchase an emergency kit or related items. This is something that car insurance companies, as well as prime auto businesses like Edmund\u0027s and Consumer Reports, all suggest for new car owners. Get all the items and equipment you would need to deal with a roadside emergency and make such situations less dangerous and inconvenient. Get maintenance-related emergency kit items like jumper cables and extra oil and coolant. Purchase other types of emergency kit items to help you with specific roadside incidents. Many of the pros recommend a set of flares for visibility on the road, as well as a flashlight to be able to inspect vehicles and other items in the dark, and a blanket to help you stay warm if your auto\u0027s heating system fails in an extremely cold environment. 2 Get the right tools. Many experts recommend purchasing a comprehensive set of tools for dealing with car-related situations. Find the right wrench set. Each specific vehicle has its own sizes of bolts and other hardware. You\u0027ll need to figure out what sizes you would use for items like battery posts and terminals, and get the right wrenches to match. You\u0027ll also want to make sure that there is a proper wrench for lug nuts, for changing or rotating tires. In addition to the tire wrench or iron, make sure you have an appropriate jack for raising the vehicle for routine maintenance or other incidents. 3 Find other maintenance items. One popular tool is a windshield scraper for maintaining visibility when ice accumulates on the windshield or windows of the vehicle. 4 Locate other visibility items as necessary. Besides the tools and equipment mentioned above, there are a few different types of simple screens and visors that some car owners like to purchase, including back window screens, extra fold downs on mirrors or other sunshade equipment. 5 Evaluate your need for accessories. Some basic accessories can also help with vehicle maintenance or convenience for drivers and passengers. Look at storage capacity for your vehicle. From CD books for vehicles with a disc player, to extra cup holders or bungee cords for holding large items safely, you may want to invest in storage-related accessories for your vehicle.

In general, if the volume of the cylinder when the piston is down is greater than the combustion chamber volume when the piston up, the space is calculated as a ratio of the volume. When the valves for exhaust and intake are closed, no air is let out, the piston raises, and the mixture of air and fuel is compressed. Compression ratio refers to how the cylinder\u0027s space changes from when the piston is down to when the piston is up. 5 factors define this equation: volume of cylinder displacement, volume of clearance, dome of piston, volume of head gasket and volume of chamber. To calculate the ratio for your vehicle, you need to use the formula, compression ration \u003d volume at below dead center divided by volume at top dead center. This is not as simple as it sounds but if you know a few key measurements, you will be able to calculate the compression ratio. Ad Steps 1 Locate your owner\u0027s manual; it will be necessary to help with measurements of parts of your engine. 2 Clean your engine as much as possible with an engine de-greaser before beginning your work. 3 Measure the bore of the cylinder with a bore gauge. 4 Measure the distance of cylinder from the piston at the bottom to the top to find the stroke of the cylinder. 5 Find the volume of the combustion chamber (from manufacturer or manual). 6 Find the compression height of the piston (from the manufacturer). 7 Find the dome/dish volume of the piston (from the manufacturer). 8 Calculate the piston-to-deck clearance (bore x bore x 0.7854 x distance between piston and deck at top dead center). 9 Measure your head gasket\u0027s thickness and bore. 10 Use the following formula to calculate the compression ratio once you have all the above measurements: cylinder volume + clearance volume + piston volume + gasket volume + chamber volume divided by clearance volume + piston volume + gasket volume + chamber volume. 11 Convert measurements to cubic centimeters if necessary from inches by multiplying inches by 16.387.

Here are instructions to help you change your CV (constant velocity) axle and front wheel bearings on a Dodge Dakota. Ad Steps Part 1 Deciding if the work is needed 1 Troubleshoot your front wheel drive system to determine if maintenance is needed. You can do the following steps to decide if the parts are worn enough to need replacing. 2 Look underneath the truck between the wheels and the front differential to see if any visible damage is evident. Leaking CV joint boots, bent parts, or oil leaks are indicators of problems. 3 Drive the truck on a smooth surface with the windows down, listening for clicking, grinding, or other unusual noises from the front of your truck. You may have someone walk beside you in an empty parking lot while you drive slowly and steer the vehicle hard to the left and right. 4 Jack up the front end of your truck and shake the wheels to see if any play is evident. The wheels should be tight so that you are not able to shake them to the left and right or up and down. Use jack stands to be safe during this check. 5 Rotate the tires while they are off the ground, listening and feeling for anything unusual. They should rotate without noticeable sound or vibrations. 6 Rock the wheels back and forth and listen for sounds from the CV joints. These may make a knocking or clicking sound if there is slack in them. They may also grind if severely worn parts are present. 7 Have a mechanic do the inspection if you have any doubts, since the parts needed for this project cost several hundred dollars. His advice may help you prevent unneeded repairs, and he may also be able to point out other parts that need attention. Part 2 Buy the needed parts 1 Make a list of the parts you need to complete the project. Since some parts may not be available off the shelf at your local auto parts supplier, checking availability before starting will save time, or at least prevent having an undrivable truck in the driveway for an extended period. 2 Write down the information on your truck before going shopping. Having the truck\u0027s information will help your auto parts supplier find the right parts for the job. The example here is a Dodge Dakota Sport, 2001 model, with a 4.7 liter (1.2 US gal) V-8 and 5 speed manual transmission. It also has four wheel antilock brakes, which does make a difference in the front wheel bearing hub assembly. You may be able to find all the information for your vehicle by the VIN number if your parts supplier has access to that database. 3 Choose the quality of the parts you want to use. For severe use, using premium quality parts will be worthwhile, but if you are shopping for economy, selecting a store brand can save over 50%. Make sure the parts are built to OEM specifications, however, so they are safe to use and fit properly. Part 3 Doing the work 1 Jack up the truck and set it on jack stands, making sure the wheels are blocked to prevent it from rolling. 2 Remove the wheel from the side you are working one. You may want to loosen the lug nuts before jacking the truck if you don\u0027t have an impact wrench for the lug nuts. 3 Remove the cotter pin from the axle shaft at the center of the hub. Next, loosen the axle nut a half turn so it can be removed later. You may need a helper to hold the front brake while loosening the axle nut. 4 Remove the brake caliper. There are two studs behind the caliper, these can be removed with an Allen wrench, either 3?16 or 1?4 inch (0.5 or 0.6 cm). Back the studs out, and remove the tension spring from the front of the caliper, then pry the pads back slightly from the brake rotor. Now the caliper can be slid off and tied back out of the way. 5 Remove the brake rotor. Make sure you do not get grease or oil on its friction surfaces. 6 Remove the axle nut. Most are a 1 1?4 inch (3.2 cm) nut, and a socket is needed to remove it. If the nut will not turn without spinning the axle, use a long pry bar between two lug studs to keep it stationary. 7 Remove the hub bearing assembly. There are three bolts that secure it to the knuckle, they can be removed with a 14 mm (9/16 inch) wrench, but they are very tight, so a cheater pipe may be needed to break them loose. If the hub has an anti lock brake sensor, either disconnect the plug and remove the clips that secure the cable, or if you are replacing the hub, just cut the wire for the time being. If the hub is stuck tight, bump it and pry it out with a large screwdriver or pry bar. 8 Remove the upper ball joint from the knuckle or unbolt it from the upper control (A) arm. This will allow the knuckle to be dropped out of the way for removal of the CV axle. Be aware the three bolts that secure the ball joint to the upper control arm have self locking nuts so the threads may be damaged if they are removed. Since these ball joints are critical to the safety of the vehicle, you should seriously consider replacing them, especially considering the relatively low cost of these parts. 9 Pull the CV axle off of the differential side shaft. The axle should slide off easily if the splines are not damaged, if it doesn\u0027t, you may have to use a slide hammer to persuade it. If a slide hammer is needed, be sure to carefully inspect the side shaft at the differential and replace it if needed. 10 Remove the oil seal at the side shaft if you are replacing it. You can use a seal removal tool, or a flat blade screwdriver to pry it out. 11 Install the new oil seal at the side shaft. Put a dab of gasket adhesive around the outer ring of the seal, and a small dab of grease or gear oil on the inner ring to prevent damage and leaks. 12 Slide the new CV axle over the side shaft on the differential. A little bit of gear oil on the splines will allow it to slide on easily. 13 Guide the outer end of the axle through the center hole in the knuckle. You may want to wrap the splines with a rag or paper towel to protect them from damage while positioning it. 14 Install the new hub bearing assembly. You will need to carefully center the CV axle splines through the hub assembly. Reinstall the three bolts that secure the assembly to the knuckle. These bolts must be torqued to the correct specifications, usually 150 foot (45.7 m) pounds. Do not use an impact wrench to install these bolts. 15 Reinstall (or install a new) the upper ball joint. If you reinstall the original upper ball joint, check the bolts to make sure there is no damage to the threads, if there is, you will need to use new bolts the same size and strength, with locking nuts. You may find you need a helper to position the upper control arm so the bolts in the ball joint line up. Tighten these bolts securely. 16 Replace the brake rotor. Make sure you check the surfaces to be sure they are not warped, pitted, or damaged in any way. They should be smooth and shiny, with not discoloration that would indicate heat damage. 17 Reinstall the brake caliper. Be sure the mounting studs are threaded correctly, as they have very fine threads that can be cross threaded if care is not taken. Install the brake spring on the outside of the caliper being sure it is centered so it will not run the rotor. 18 Install the antilock sensor cable, anchoring it to the brake fluid line and frame in the same locations the previous cable was anchored, if you have replaced the wheel bearing hub assembly and your vehicle is equipped with four wheel antilock brakes. 19 Install the CV axle nut and tighten it securely. You can check the vehicle\u0027s specifications for this nut, but at least make sure it is tightened securely. Replace the cotter pin in the end of the axle when the nut is tight. 20 Put your tire back on the truck and tighten the lug nuts. Remove the jack stands and lower the vehicle to the ground. You can now retighten any bolts or lug nuts that turned while the wheel was off the ground. 21 Test drive the vehicle, making sure the steering feels tight, and there are no unusual sounds from the new parts which could indicate improper installation or other damaged parts. 22 Return any parts which had a core charge to the retailer you purchased them from, for a refund of the core charge. If you bought new parts, there may not be a core charge applied, so the old parts can be recycled or discarded. \u003d\u003d Tips \u003d\u003d Check the drive train including the front drive shaft, differential, and transfer case while the vehicle is jacked up to determine if these parts need attention. Use air wrenches where possible to make this task easier. Do this work on a concrete floor, or place plywood or another material underneath the vehicle to keep the working conditions cleaner and to avoid losing parts. Use quality replacement parts for the best service and safety.

In order to keep your car running properly you must sometimes change them out. Fortunately, it\u0027s possible to do this yourself. Ad Steps Part 1 Removing the Vehicle’s Axle Nut 1 Remove the vehicle’s hubcap. Before so much as jacking up the vehicle, you need to remove the axle nut. Start by removing the hubcap for the respective wheel of the CV axle to be replaced. For vehicles with rims, you may simply have a cap at the center of the wheel rather than a hubcap. 2 Remove the cotter pin from the axle nut. If your vehicle has a cotter pin securing the axle nut, you will need to remove it. The pin will resemble a bobby pin with the ends folded back to hold it in place.[1] You will need to use pliers to straighten the two bent ends of the cotter pin before you can remove it. If the pin is stuck, try spraying it the a penetrating lubricant from a hardware or automotive store.[2] The lubricant should actually help with the axle nut as well. 3 Remove the axle nut. Once the cotter pin is out, you can remove the axle nut. The nut will take significant torque to remove, which is why it is much safer to remove the nut before jacking up the vehicle. Unfortunately, axle nuts do not have a standard size, and the socket size required will be different for different vehicles. The parts department at a certified dealership for your vehicle make should be able to tell you the exact size if you want to check before starting the project. Part 2 Removing the Wheel and Brake Assembly 1 Jack up the appropriate side of the car. Next, you will need to remove the wheel, which requires lifting the vehicle. Consult your vehicle’s owner’s manual for the correct spot to jack up your car, and ensure that you pick a spot on the frame and not the much more fragile body. Double-check that the vehicle is in park and that the parking brake is engaged before jacking up the vehicle. 2 Place the vehicle on jack stands. Once you have the vehicle lifted enough to place your jack stand, ease it back down onto the stand, which is more stable than the jack alone. If you have concerns about using jack stands, consult Use Jack Stands for more information. 3 Remove the wheel. The lug nuts securing the wheel will already be exposed from when you removed the hubcap. Remove the lug nuts and the wheel the same way you would if you were changing a tire. If you need guidance for this step, you can consult Change a Tire for assistance. 4 Remove the brake caliper. Once the wheel is off, the brake caliper and brake rotor will be clearly visible. The caliper housing is the larger piece attached to the outside of the rotor. The caliper will be held in place on the rear side of the rotor by bolts in a mounting bracket.[3] The specific configuration will depend on your make and model year vehicle. The mounting bracket most commonly uses 17mm bolts.[4] Since the caliper is connected to your vehicle’s brake line, you want to keep slack in the brake line instead of letting it hang. You can easily suspend the caliper from a short bungee cord to keep it out of your way without putting too much stress on the brake line.[5] 5 Unbolt the outer tie rod from steering knuckle. The outer tie rod is literally a rod bolted to the steering knuckle, which is just behind the rotor. This piece will likely be bolted with another 17mm bolt.[6] Like the axle nut, this bolt may be held in place with a cotter pin. Penetrating lubricant may help you more easily remove the pin and bolt. The tie rod may still be pretty snug in the steering knuckle even after removing the bolt. Tape the steering knuckle joint with a hammer (hitting the knuckle where the rod goes through and not the threaded portion of the tie rod) to help remove it.[7] 6 Unbolt the hub from the strut tower. Two more 17mm bolts will connect the wheel hub to the strut tower. Once you remove these bolts, the hub should only be connected by the axle through the center hole, and you should easily be able to remove it. Since these are actual bolts, you will need to secure the head of the bolt while loosening the nut, or it will just turn.[8] Part 3 Removing and Replacing the CV Axle 1 Pry the CV joint. Follow the axle back, and you will see the actual joint where it slides into the transmission. You can use a small pry bar or sturdy flathead screwdriver to pry the axle from the joint.[9] If the axle doesn’t immediately come loose, try twisting it back and force to break the seal.[10] It’s normal for some transmission fluid to leak out as you remove the axle from the cv joint. You should put down a catch pan. On your vehicle, the axle may have to pass through an enclose piece called a wishbone before it’s completely free. You can remove the band from the inner boot to help the old axle pass through.[11] 2 Insert the new CV axle into the transmission housing. Just as you removed the old CV axle, insert the new one into the same spot in the transmission housing. The peg will slide all the way in until the axle is flush against the housing.[12] There is a small C-clip on the axle that you will feel snap into place.[13] If the axle isn’t quite flush, you can use a rubber mallet to gently tap it into place.[14] 3 Reinsert the axle through the hub assembly. The new axle will have to be reinserted into the center of the hub assembly at the same spot where you removed the old axle. 4 Refasten the assemblies in the order you removed them. Starting with the hub assembly to the strut tower, refasten all of the bolts you removed. Reconnect the outer tie rod to the steering knuckle next, and then reattach the caliper. Any old cotter pins may be brittle, so you should replace them with new ones rather than reusing the old pins.[15] 5 Reattach the wheel. By this time, you can put the wheel back on the vehicle (again, the same as you would when changing a tire). After the wheel is on, you can lower the car off the jack and jack stands. 6 Tighten the axle nut. Finally, you can retighten the axle nut once the vehicle is back on the ground. Make sure that you still have the parking brake engaged while tightening. It’s not a bad idea to clean the threaded part of the axle with a brake cleaner in case any grease has gotten on it while feeding it through the hub.[16] Reader Questions and Answers Unanswered Questions What could the problem if I just replaced CV axle and tire still won\u0027t turn Answer this question Flag as bad question Flag as bad question Show more unanswered questions Add New Question Answered Questions Don\u0027t see your question?

There is no squeak that lets you know it is time. If your car ran fine and then the motor stopped suddenly with a clunk and won\u0027t restart, it is likely your timing belt. The timing on the engine must be set exactly, or the valves and the pistons may collide, resulting in very expensive engine repairs. If your timing belt is broken, then make sure valve damage was not done before proceeding with the belt replacement. The service manual for your vehicle will let you know if your timing belt will or will not damage the valves. Ad Steps Part 1 Purchase 1 Buy a new belt before proceeding with removing the old one. If this is a maintenance service, you may want to locate a new belt before removing the old one. If the belt has broken or slipped, you can wait until the old one is removed before buying a new one so you can compare them to be sure the new one is the correct one for your vehicle. Most vehicles require rubber timing belts, as opposed to older steel timing chains. Available for a few dollars at any auto parts store, you\u0027ll likely need to change yours every 90,000 to 120,000 miles (140,000 to 190,000 km), depending on your engine. 2 Gather the information about your vehicle. You will need to know the make, model, and year model of the vehicle, as well as the engine type and size. Some models may have variations even during one model year, so your VIN may also be helpful. You can purchase a new belt at a dealer or an auto parts store. 3 Make sure you also purchase gaskets and gasket adhesives required for reassembly. Your parts supplier should be able to tell you what you will need. Timing belt kits are also available that include replacement gaskets and other necessary materials to complete the job.[1] Part 2 Fitting 1 Disconnect the negative battery cable. Ensure you have your radio security code (if equipped) any preset radio stations on a piece of paper to allow for quick resetting once repairs are made. 2 Remove the alternator belt. Depending on your model, you may need to remove the serpentine belt to get to the timing belt. Loosen the nuts, pushing the alternator if necessary to create slack on the belt and remove it.[2] 3 Remove any accessories such as the power steering pump, alternator, and air conditioning compressor so you can access the timing belt cover. Do not remove pressurized fittings from the air conditioning compressor, most can be unbolted and pushed out of the way without discharging the system. Remove valve cover assembly as required for access to timing belt. 4 Remove the distributor cap if your vehicle is equipped with one. You may need to pry apart the retaining clips to free the distributor cap, as well as remove any screws holding the cap in place.[3] Some modern cars with electronic ignitions don\u0027t have distributors. They will have a cam and crankshaft position sensor instead. The important thing is to be able to determine Top Dead Center (TDC) on the first cylinder. Consult the engine repair manual, since these will differ by model. 5 Line up the timing marks. Using a wrench or socket on the crankshaft bolt rotate the engine until the timing mark on the crankshaft pulley is aligned with the 0° mark on the timing scale. Verify the distributor rotor is aligned with the index mark on the distributor housing indicating the rotor is in position to fire the number one cylinder. If not, rotate the engine another full turn. Don\u0027t do this on interference engines unless you\u0027re sure the belt is still intact. If you have not already bent your valves with a broken timing belt, you will likely do so if you spin the crankshaft without the camshaft spinning. 6 Determine if the harmonic balancer pulley needs to be removed to remove the timing belt cover. Often, the cover saddles over the end of the crankshaft, and this pulley will not allow you to remove the cover without first removing it. Note that an additional seal will be needed to reinstall it if this is the case and special crankshaft pulley and gear removal alignment tools may be needed. 7 Remove the bolts or screws holding the timing cover in place. Remove this cover off the engine. Some engines have a two-piece timing cover. Remove any components or accessory drive belts that interfere with removing the timing belt cover. This varies by model; consult your service manual to determine which parts need to be removed from your vehicle. 8 Check for proper alignment of the crank and camshaft timing marks. Many engines have a dot or index line on the pulleys and/or sprockets that must be lined up with corresponding marks on the block, cylinder head, or accessory shaft. On some engines, the index mark on the camshaft sprocket aligns with the parting line of the first camshaft-bearing tower. This is very important if you\u0027re replacing a timing belt that has broken. Consult your service manual for the correct alignment procedure for your vehicle and correct any misalignment before installing the new timing belt. These marks may also be displayed on a label on the timing belt cover on some engines. 9 Check the area around the belt for signs of oil leakage. Look around the camshaft and crankshaft seals, as well as the valve cover and oil pan. Check for coolant leaks from the water pump and water pump by-pass hose. Leaks should be repaired before the new belt is installed. Part 3 Loosening 1 Loosen the mounting bolt(s) holding the belt tensioner using any special cam holding tools, while following the service manual. Do not remove the tensioner completely unless replacing it. Instead, pivot the spring-loaded tensioner away from the belt and then retighten the mounting bolt(s) to hold the tensioner in the loose position. 2 Examine the tensioner pulley for damage such as dents or cracks. Spin the tensioner pulley and listen for a rattle or humming noise that would indicate loose or worn bearings. Uneven wear at the rear of the old timing belt could indicate a misalignment between the tension pulley and timing belt due to worn bearings. If any indications of damage or worn bearings are found, replace the tensioner pulley. The permanently lubricated tensioner pulley bearing can become dry, worn, loose, broken or can freeze up, so the best practice is to replace it, if it\u0027s not new. Part 4 Installation 1 Slide the belt off the sprockets. With the tension on the timing belt relieved, the belt should slide easily off the sprockets. Timing belts that have been used for a long time may stick in the pulley grooves and require some gentle prying with a screwdriver to release. Inspect the timing belt pulleys and water pump for any need to replace before proceeding to install the new belt. 2 Replace with a new belt and reassemble. Torque the timing belt to the proper specifications, paying special attention to \"torquing\" specs on the engine manual, particularly the crankshaft pulley mounting bolt which usually has a very high torque spec. If equipped with a hydraulic timing belt tensioner, removal may be required to compress the piston back into the cylinder after a ratchet is released. Place into a vise and compress until holes line up to allow the insertion of a holding pin. Once the pin is in place, the tensioner can be re-installed when the belt is installed with the pin pulled to allow the tensioner to place tension on timing belt.

Ask it here: Submit Video Tips A novice should buy, at considerable expense, the manufacturer\u0027s shop manual for the specific model vehicle and engine which is to have the belt changed. These manuals are written for professional mechanics, assume some degree of mechanical expertise, are very detailed in that they state belt tensioner values, bolt torques, fastener locations, etc. It\u0027s important to always follow instructions specific to your make and model, especially if you\u0027re unfamiliar with the mechanism. The shop manual, though somewhat costly, should pay for itself with a single repair. If your timing belt is broken, then you will need to determine if your engine valves got bent when the belt broke. If it bent the valves, then more major engine repairs would be needed. This is called an interference motor meaning that the valve will contact the pistons if the belt is broken. If the engine is called a non-interference motor, then this means the valves and pistons should not contact each other if the belt is broken. Some vehicles may require a special tool to reach tensioner mounting bolts hidden by the motor mounts, while others are necessary to release a spring-loaded timing belt tensioner. Most engines have a spring-loaded tensioner that can be operated using common sockets and wrenches, though some will require a male hex wrench/Allen wrench. Timing belts are a wear item. Most are to be changed every 60,000 to 90,000 miles (97,000 km to 127,000 km) for preventive maintenance. They may break causing expensive damage to interference engines due to the collision of valves and pistons as they go out of sync. Having them replaced at intervals is the best way to save yourself from a very costly repair. Do not wait till the belt breaks causing major engine damage. The task of the timing belt is to sync the valves and the pistons. An engine belt out of time will contact pistons and valves, just like the timing on a WWI aircraft machine gun, which, without a timing mechanism would shoot off the propeller.

This allows remaining liquid refrigerant to evaporate before continuing through the system and the device contains a desiccant to remove any moisture the system contains. Here are steps to help you change your accumulator as well as the expansion valve in your truck AC. Ad Steps 1 Check your local laws to make sure it is legal for a non-certified individual to do this type of work. Since it will require purging any refrigerant, and purchasing replacement refrigerant, some jurisdictions may require a license to do the work. 2 Make sure changing the accumulator is necessary. Since the accumulator contains a desiccant to remove moisture from the refrigerant, if the system has been discharged and improperly recharged or needs recharging, changing the accumulator will help ensure the system works efficiently after recharging. It is also recommended the accumulator is replaced whenever a compressor is replaced as well. 3 Buy the needed parts. You can order a new accumulator from suppliers online, your local auto parts dealer, or from your vehicle manufacturer dealership parts store. Buy a replacement expansion valve (also known as an orifice tube) if you plan to replace it as well. The expansion valve is located in the refrigerant tubing at the bottom of the evaporator coils, and as with the accumulator, they can collect debris which impede their performance if the system has been compromised. Also, when changing the compressor, replacement of the expansion valve is usually a requirement for warranty coverage of the new compressor. 4 Remove or discharge any remaining refrigerant from the AC system. It is better to have this done at a shop that has a refrigerant reclamation machine, but if the system is already discharged, this step can be skipped. Simply loosen the schrader valve on the low pressure (suction) charging fitting and listen for escaping refrigerant to determine if the system is still charged. 5 Remove the pressure sensor connector from the accumulator. This can usually be unplugged, but be careful, as there may be a clip that needs to be depressed or pried up to release it. 6 Loosen the inlet and outlet couplings on the accumulator. Use the correct wrenches, and make sure the fittings do not allow the refrigerant lines to twist. You may to need two wrenches, one on the fitting and another on the compression nut that secures it to prevent damaging the refrigerant lines. 7 Loosen the clamp or support device that secures the accumulator in position. You can now completely remove the couplings and lift the accumulator out of the engine compartment. Make sure to keep it upright, as refrigerant oil and other nasty liquids may be in the bottom of it. 8 Loosen the fittings that join the high pressure refrigerant line near where it enters the bottom of the evaporator coil. Be sure to use a wrench on both nuts, since one is soldered onto the line and allowing it to twist will damage it. After the coupling is completely loosened, you can pull the two pipes apart. 9 Look for a plastic (usually) tab just inside the tubing leading into the evaporator coil housing. You can grip this with a pair of needle nosed pliers to pull the expansion valve (again, also called the orifice tube) from the tube. Note that refrigerant oil may leak from the tube if any has accumulated in the evaporator coils. 10 Blow out the evaporator coils with compressed air or compressed nitrogen to make sure no oil or debris is clogging them. 11 Install the new expansion valve, the tapered end with an o ring should go in toward the evaporator coils. Check to see if the o ring in the refrigerant line coupling is still in good condition, then reattach the fittings that connect this pipe. 12 Install the new accumulator into its mounting bracket or support. 13 Install the pressure sensor in the new accumulator. You can either buy a new one, or remove the one from the old accumulator and reuse it. If reusing your old one, it is generally a good idea to use a new seal or o ring when reinstalling it. 14 Install new o rings on the refrigerant line fittings on the accumulator, then reconnect the fittings and tighten them securely. You should now be able to either charge the system with new refrigerant or have it done at a licensed auto repair shop. Continue reading for basic instructions if you plan to proceed yourself. 15 Use a vacuum pump to evacuate the air conditioning system so no moisture remains in it. Allow the pump to hold a vacuum for at least 90 minutes before recharging the system. 16 Attach a refrigerant charging hose to a can of refrigerant, puncture the can (follow the instructions on the can if using 12 oz cans that require it), vent the air from the hose, and make sure the fittings are not leaking. 17 Start the engine and turn the AC on high cool and high fan. Open the charging valve and allow the refrigerant to enter the system. This can be a very slow process depending on the ambient temperature, do not rush it. 18 Test all fittings for leak using a foaming soap mixture, clean up, and dispose of old parts and cleaning products safely.

A quick check with a handheld diagnostic scanner/reader will confirm that you need to change the oxygen sensor on your vehicle. Depending on the make and model of your vehicle, there will be between two and four O2 sensors located on your exhaust system. There is at least one sensor in front of the catalytic converter, plus one in each of the car’s exhaust manifold.[1] The diagnostic scanner/reader should tell you which bank of sensors has gone bad. Ad Steps 1 Locate the oxygen sensor on your vehicle by looking for a part that looks like a spark plug that sticks out from the exhaust pipe. It will have an electrical connection attached to it. 2 Disconnect the electrical connection on the oxygen sensor. Use a flat tip screwdriver to push in the tabs and pull the connection apart. 3 Unscrew the oxygen sensor off the exhaust pipe using either an open-end wrench or a special socket made to remove it. The majority of oxygen sensors will take an SAE 7?8 inch (2.2 cm) wrench. 4 Compare your new oxygen sensor to the old one. If the new one did not come with an electrical connection, but just with the wires stubbed out, you need to do a little work. Cut off the old connector from the bad oxygen sensor, strip the wires and solder the wires to the new oxygen sensor. You can also use butt connectors. Use heat sensitive shrink tape to seal the connections. Follow manufacturer\u0027s instructions to know which wires to tie together. 5 Reverse the steps used in removing the oxygen sensor and install the new part. Add a small amount of anti-seize to the threads of the new sensor. Screw it in place clockwise and snug it down with the socket or open-end wrench. Do not over tighten the sensor as you might strip the threads. 6 Plug the electrical connections back in. 7 Turn on the ignition key, but do not start your vehicle.

Ad Steps Method 1 Locating and Diagnosing 1 Make sure it\u0027s a fuse issue. When one circuit has too much electricity flowing through it, the fuse blows to prevent serious damage and even fire. The best way of knowing if a fuse has blown, is if an electric component instantly stops working i.e. window stops while rolling up or down, radio stops workings, or all of the dash lights go out at once. If an electric component has been slowly getting worse, it is not likely a fuse but it is still good to check the fuses regularly. 2 Find the fuse panel. The owner\u0027s manual will tell where the vehicle\u0027s fuse panel is. Most models situate the fuse panel on the driver\u0027s side of the dashboard and under the steering wheel, but location varies from vehicle to vehicle. Remove the fuse panel\u0027s cover; there will be several different color-coded fuses plugged in. These colors, along with the numbers stamped on the fuses, indicate different amperage ratings. On the backside of the fuse panel there will be a diagram that shows which fuse corresponds with which electrical component. If the owner\u0027s manual is unavailable, try contacting a dealership for the location or a simple internet search can provide enough information to locate the fuse panel and specific fuses. 3 Try to test fuses before removing. Once the fuse panel is located, remove the cover and locate the fuse puller, most vehicles come with a small fuse puller but not all will have one. Before removing any fuses, it is possible to test a fuse before removing it, this requires either a continuity test light, or a multi-meter / ohm meter. 4 Test the suspect fuses. To test a fuse without removing it, using the two probes of either the test light or multi-meter, touch the two small metal tabs located on the top of the fuse. These tabs can be tricky to connect to, but once sure that the probes are making contact, if the fuse has continuity (test light lights up) or has a resistance reading (may read 0 or 0.001milli-ohm) then the fuse is good. If these tools are unavailable, simply use the fuse puller that was in the fuse panel, or a small pair of pliers, or just bare fingers to remove and visually inspect any fuses. If the fuse is bad, it needs to be replaced. Method 2 Fuse Removal and Replacement 1 When replacing a fuse you must use a fuse that has the same amperage rating. Use the fuse panel diagram, the numbered color-coded fuses and the owner’s manual to help you determine the correct amperage for your new fuse. Once you have the right fuse gently push it into the correct slot, make sure it’s completely installed, and then put the fuse panel back on the car. 2 Check the circuit. Once you are done replacing the fuse, turn the ignition and check to see if the circuit giving you trouble is working correctly. If it is working, chances are you just had a temporary surge that blew the fuse. If that\u0027s the case, then you just solved the problem.

Struts are basically a spring-mounted shock absorber that\u0027s been a basic part of car manufacturing since the 1950s. They get worn out with use and sometimes will break if you\u0027ve gone over some particularly bumpy terrain, resulting in a kind of deep click sound when you turn. Purchasing a quick-strut assembly is the quickest and easiest way to replace the struts yourself. Below, you can learn to remove the old strut and replace a new assembly. Ad Steps Part 1 Exposing the Strut 1 Locate the strut assembly. The struts are cylinder-shaped pistons filled with hydraulic fluid, usually shaped a bit like a metallic road cone with a spring wrapped around it. Open the hood and locate the strut bolts, usually a circle of three bolts on a pan in the engine compartment, to each side of the car, near the windshield. In the center of the ring of bolts will be the bolt for the strut pan itself. Don\u0027t loosen any of these bolts yet, especially not the center bolt, but use this to guide you to your working spot.[1] 2 Remove the wheel. First, loosen the bolts securing the wheel with a lug wrench and lift the car with a jack, positioning the jack according to the Owner\u0027s Manual instructions for changing a tire. Once the car is raised, position a jack stand under the car for stability. Remove the bolts that secure the wheel and remove the wheel. It\u0027s always important to use jack stands to secure the car. Do not attempt to do this job only supporting the car on the jack. Jacks can shift suddenly, dropping the car and possibly trapping you under it. Car jacks use hydraulic power that can fail suddenly and need to be backed up by jack stands to do the job safely. Invest in a couple of jack stands. 3 Remove the brake line support if necessary. You might need to remove the brake line support bracket from the strut assembly. This isn\u0027t a feature on all cars, so disregard this step if you don\u0027t see a small bracket holding the brake line to the strut. If you do, unscrew the bracket with the appropriate size socket wrench and move the brake line up and out of the way so you can remove the strut. 4 Drop the sway bar if necessary. Also called the stabilizer or the anti-roll bar, the sway bar works along with the strut assembly to stabilize the car during bumps and irregular road conditions. To do this, you need to remove the mounting bracket with a socket wrench and rotate the sway bar out of the way. Look for a small metal bracket attaching a metal bar (usually black) to the strut and remove it. Again, this won\u0027t always be an obstacle on all cars; you might just need to loosen the strut from the steering knuckle and free it. Once you\u0027ve gotten these obstacles out of the way, you\u0027re ready to remove the old strut. Part 2 Removing the Old Strut 1 Remove the bolts from the steering knuckle. There are most likely two or three large bolts holding the strut to the steering knuckle. Remove these by removing the nuts from the assembly and loosening the strut. This is often rusted on and difficult to remove. You might choose to spray some rust loosening spray like WD-40 on equal onto the bolts before you can free them. Try hammering a few times on the knuckle itself to loosen things up a bit before hammering directly on the bolts holding the strut to the knuckle. This might take some elbow grease. Depending on the model of your car, you may also need to place your jack under the steering knuckle to raise it slightly and make the bolts visible. Once the strut bolts are out the strut and steering knuckle are separated. 2 Open the hood and locate the strut towers to remove the bolts. Usually they are located at the midpoint of the inside fender well and look like cylinders. They are most likely held in by three small bolts. Remove the strut tower bolts. Do not remove the center nut or the strut will come apart and it is under high spring tension. Since you\u0027ve removed the bolts from the steering knuckle, the strut might fall loose after you remove these bolts. It might help to have a partner holding onto the strut assembly while you loosen these bolts. 3 Pull the old strut free. Don\u0027t unscrew the center bolt on the top of the strut pan until you\u0027ve compressed the springs, if you\u0027re going to. If you\u0027ve got a quick-strut assembly, you can discard the old strut and skip forward to installing your new fully-assembled strut. It\u0027s recommended that the beginner forego attempts to compress the spring on the old strut using a spring compressor or spring clamps. This method is used to save money by salvaging the old spring and installing it on the new strut, but if you don\u0027t have your own strut compressor, it will run you $700. It makes more sense to spend the extra cash on a quick-strut assembly, which is pre-assembled and only requires that you install it in the car. 4 If you have access to a spring compressor, consider removing the spring. Making sure the compressor is secure and pointed away from anything that you do not want damaged, compress the spring with a spring compressor, or have someone more experienced do this. At the very top of the strut is a large nut on top of what looks like a disc, but is actually the strut bearing. Remove the large nut on top of the strut with ratchet and socket combination, and hold the strut rod with a wrench just below the strut bearing. Make a note of the strut top plate rotation before removal and reinstall in the same position. The strut can now be removed from the spring while the spring is still compressed by the spring compressor. Check the top plate bearing if it needs to be replaced. 5 Assemble the new strut. Put the new strut into the spring. Make sure to include any rubber parts from the old strut. Install the strut bearing over the spring and install the new strut rod nut to the manufacture specified torque while holding the strut rod to prevent spinning the strut shaft. Again, if you\u0027ve purchased a quick-strut, don\u0027t worry about monkeying around with the spring on the old strut. Discard it and skip to installation. Part 3 Installing a New Strut 1 Install the completed strut assembly back into the steering knuckle. Replace the bolts, leaving them finger tight, allowing the assembly to move freely. 2 Place the strut assembly back into the strut tower and replace the strut tower bolts. Now you can tighten the bolts with your wrench, securing the strut assembly to the steering knuckle and torquing to the manufacturer\u0027s specifications. If you needed to move the sway bar or the brake line support, replace these at this time. 3 Replace the wheel. Tighten the lug bolts finger tight before lowering the car. Jack the vehicle up slightly to remove the load on the jack stands, then remove the jack stands and lower the vehicle to the ground. Tighten the wheel to the proper specifications, as well as the strut tower bolts. 4 Perform a final check to make sure nothing was incorrectly fitted. Test drive at low speed to evaluate the vehicle safely. Avoid high speed driving or high-traffic areas. It\u0027s possible that the vehicle may require alignment. If the vehicle pulls to either side or otherwise does not drive normally, perform alignment by measuring the degree of difference and adding cams to adjust the issue.[2] 5 Repeat the process for all struts you want to change. It\u0027s cheaper to replace struts on a need-to basis, but they tend to wear out all at once, so you might as well do the rest if you\u0027re willing to invest in two or four new struts. The process will work in the same basic way for struts in all positions. Not all cars have rear struts. Check your owner\u0027s manual before buying unnecessary parts.

Do not attempt to change your springs/struts unless you fully accept the risk that the compressor, spring, strut, or jack may fail, resulting in possible injury or death. Spring compressors are not all built the same —Inspect your spring compressor for possible signs of inferior construction or poor design. Some struts or the steering knuckles on some vehicles have slotted holes and will require an alignment after the struts are replaced. Do not drive these vehicles without getting an alignment or the tires will get damaged. Warnings Beginners should not attempt to use a spring compressor without proper instruction or assistance. They can possibly slip or otherwise fail if used incorrectly, releasing the energy stored in the compressed spring and damaging anything it may hit when it explosively decompresses.

For those that suffer from allergies or find debris on their dashboard when they use the climate controls, this will surely help. Ad Steps 1 The Cabin Filter is not unlike the standard air filters you replace regularly. The difference is that this one is a bit thinner/smaller. 2 Locate the passenger side cowl. In plain English, this is the plastic piece just below where your window wipers sit when they are at rest. There are two \"cowls\" One on the driver side, one on the passenger side. You will be removing the passenger side only. 3 With the hood up, stand at the front, passenger side of your car. Face your front windshield and look for a series of small metal retaining clips at the base of the cowl (closest to the engine, not the windshield) You will remove the first three only - counting from the passenger side toward the center. One clip holds the left and right cowls where they meet. 4 Use a very thin screwdriver or knife to carefully pry up the retaining clips and work them off the cowl. Set these aside in a safe place. Close your hood. Gently lift the rubber seal that is molded to the cowl from the windshield and locate the four more retaining clips. These don\u0027t come off, as the others did. Simply insert a small flat head screwdriver and press down on the barbed portion of the clip to release it. For ease of access, you may want to lift the wiper into the up position. Just don\u0027t forget to lay it back down before you open the hood again. 5 Open the hood and remove the cowl. It should come loose quite easily. 6 Find the plastic visor that fits over the filter, but was under the cowl you just removed. There is rubber seal that runs along the top of it and is not necessary to remove. Look just under the visor and you\u0027ll see the Cabin Air Filter. The left side of the visor is a friction fit. The right side has a simple snap clip molded in to the plastic visor. Lift up on the visor. The snap clip should release itself with gentle pressure. Now you should be able to reach in and remove the Cabin Air Filter. 7 Use a shop vac to remove any large debris like leaves, bugs, etc. from the surrounding housing/area. 8 Replace the filter and set the visor by pushing it back into place. 9 Simply reverse these instructions to put everything else back together. 10 Close the hood.

Its basic purpose is to allow the valve to be opened, and then return each valve to the closed position while keep it tight against the seat throughout the combustion process. The following instructions can be applied to the replacement process of valve springs, from start to finish, on any Gen III/IV GM LS based V-8. Ad Steps Part 1 Valve Cover Removal 1 Locate the coil packs on the drivers side valve cover. 2 Disconnect the spark plugs. Beginning with the forward most coil, trace the spark plug wire down to the spark plug. Remove the wire from the spark plug by firmly grasping the boot at the end of the wire and pulling on it. Let the plug wire dangle from the coil. Repeat this process working front to back until all four wires on the drivers side are disconnected from their respective spark plug. 3 Locate the large connector between the center-most coils. Using a flat head screwdriver, apply gentle upward pressure on the clip by prying between the clip and the connector body, while gently pulling the male end of the connector out towards the center of the engine. Tuck the male end out of the way for now. 4 Loosen the bolts. Using a 3/8 drive ratchet and a 10mm socket, loosen the five bolts attaching the coil bracket to the top of the valve cover. Carefully thread each bolt out by hand, being sure to keep the coil pack assembly from falling. Once the assembly is free, remove from the engine bay and set it aside for now. Using a 3/8 drive ratchet and a 8mm socket, loosen the four valve cover bolts in the center of the valve cover. Once loose, gently lift the valve cover off of the cylinder head. If the valve cover sticks, gently pry between the cover and cylinder head. Set the valve cover off to the side. Repeat the procedure to remove the passenger side valve cover. Part 2 Valve Spring Replacement 1 Locate the forward most spark plug on the driver’s side. Using a 3/8 ratchet, a 3 inch extension, and a 5/8 spark plug socket, loosen the spark plug. Once loose, remove the ratchet from the extension and thread the spark plug out the rest of the way by hand. Remove plug and set aside. Repeat this process until all four spark plugs are removed from the driver side cylinder head. 2 Locate the rocker arms above each valve spring. Beginning with the forward most rocker arm, use a 3/8 ratchet and a 10mm socket to loosen and remove the rocker arm bolt. Remove the rocker and mark as number one with grease marker. Set aside. Continue this process for the remaining 7 rockers, numerically labelling the order of which they are removed. 3 Thread air fitting into forward most spark plug hole. Tighten firmly by hand. 4 Install the base of the valve spring compressor. It is installed on to the cylinder head between the first two valve springs, by threading the supplied hardware into the rocker arm bolt receptacles. Slide the compressor onto the stud, ensuring ample space between the valve spring locks and edges of the compressor. Thread the provided nut onto the stud until it\u0027s snug against the compressor. 5 Apply air to air fitting using and air compressor. 6 Tighten the nut on the compressor. Use the 3/8 drive ratchet with the 1/2in socket. The valve stem and locks will begin to protrude from the valve spring retainer. Continue until the spring has been compressed approximately ¼ of an inch. Using a pen magnet, pick up the lock halves from the valve stem. 7 Loosen and remove the nut on the valve spring compressor. Slide the compressor off the stud. Remove the two valve springs and retainers. 8 Place the new valve springs around the valve stems and into the seats. Reinstall the retainers on top of each spring. Slide the compressor onto the stud and thread the nut onto the stud until the compressor is snug against the springs. 9 Tighten the nut on the compressor. Use a 3/8 ratchet and a ½ inch socket. Ensure the valve stem will pass unobstructed through the retainer as you continue to compress the valve springs. Continue until approximately ¼ inch of the valve stem protrudes from the retainer. 10 Apply a pea sized amount of white lithium grease around the tip of the valve stem. Install both valve lock halves directly on to the valve stem, using the grease as a sort of temporary adhesive. Ensure the locks are properly seated. Repeat the process on the second valve stem. 11 Slowly loosen nut on compressor. Be sure the locks remain in place and seat properly in the retainer as the valve spring decompresses. 12 Release air from the cylinder. Do this once the valve springs are installed. Remove air fitting from the spark plug boss. Remove the valve spring compressor and base from the cylinder head. Do the same process for the remaining 6 valve springs, working front to back 2 by 2. 13 Reinstall the rocker arms into their respective numerical position. Ensure the pushrod is properly seated in the cup of each rocker. Reinstall the rocker arm bolts and snug by hand. 14 Set torque wrench to 20 ft lbs. Using the torque wrench and a 10mm socket, tighten each rocker bolt until audible click is heard from torque wrench. 15 Reinstall each spark plug. Thread them back in using a 3in extension and a 5/8 spark plug socket. Attach a 3/8 ratchet to the extension and tighten the spark plug. Do the same process on the passenger side valve springs. Part 3 Valve Cover Reinstallation 1 Set the driver side valve cover onto its respective cylinder head. Thread the 4 valve cover bolts through the cover and into the cylinder head. Snug all four by hand. 2 Set torque wrench to 8 ft lbs. Tighten inner two valve cover bolts with torque wrench and 8mm socket until audible click is head from torque wrench.

Replace or clean your air filter at the recommended interval to keep air flowing freely and your car running its best. Air filters are inexpensive and quick to replace, so you can do this routine maintenance yourself. Ad Steps 1 Obtain the correct replacement filter. It should be the same as the one you will replace. Consult your owner\u0027s manual or auto parts store if you need assistance finding the right part. 2 Secure the vehicle. Park the car on level ground and apply the parking brake. Shift into first gear (manual transmission) or Park (automatic transmission), and turn off the ignition. 3 Open the bonnet (hood). Release the bonnet with the lever inside the car. Move the exterior bonnet catch for final release. Lift the bonnet and secure it with the prop rod. 4 Locate the air filter unit. The air filter unit is usually situated on top of the engine. On older cars with carburetors the filter is usually under a bulky, round cover made of plastic or metal. Newer, fuel-injected cars tend to have a square or rectangular air filter housing can be found slightly off centre between the front grill and the engine. 5 Remove the air filter cover. Loosen the hose clamp that seals the air conduct. Undo all the screws holding the air filter cover. Some models have wing nuts; other air filters are just clamped on with a quick release system. Keep screws and other parts together and in a safe location so you can find them later. Pull the cover out of the air conduit and lift it up so it comes off the lower part of the housing. Consult a mechanic if you don\u0027t know how to lift the cover. 6 Take out the air filter. Now you can see a round or rectangular filter made of cotton, paper or gauze. Filters have a rubber rim that seals off the unit\u0027s interior. Simply lift the filter out of the housing. 7 Clean the air filter housing.Connect the air hose to the compressor and use the compressed air to blow out the dust, or use a vacuum cleaner to suck up any dirt. Seal the air conduit with removable adhesive tape. It only takes a minute and that way you won\u0027t get any dirt into the engine whilst cleaning. 8 Replace the filter. Replace the old filter with a new one. Simply insert it into the housing with the rubber rim facing up. Make sure the edges are sealed by the rubber rim. 9 Replace the cover. Carefully insert the cover back into the air conduit and then press the entire piece down onto the lower half of the air filter unit. Make sure it\u0027s on straight and securely; otherwise you could alter engine performance. Tighten all the screws or clamps and recheck that you have put everything firmly back together by rocking the unit gently with both hands. Shut the bonnet securely. 10 Check the filter regularly to keep your car breathing at maximum efficiency by keeping the dust out. 11 Change the filter every 50,000 km (30,000 miles), or about once a year. If you drive in a dusty area, it will need replacement more often. Your owner\u0027s manual or periodic maintenance guide should have recommendations for your car.

Overtime the oil in your engine begins to break down, and particles begin to clog and your oil filter will not work properly. Changing your cars oil depends on two things, how far you drive, and the type of vehicle you drive. Usually people will get their cars oil changed every 3 months or 3000-4000km. Getting your oil changed at the dealership or lube shop gets expensive, so I am going to tell you how to change your oil in a 1999 Honda CRV for half the price. Ad Steps 1 Hoist or jack up your car. There are many ways you can jack up/hoist your car. The three most common ways to hoist/jack up your car is with a two-post hoist, hydraulic floor jack, and ramps. If you are using the two-post hoist, you can drive your car in between the two posts and then position the hoist legs onto the pinch welds of your vehicle or the designated hoisting points. (You can find the designated hoisting points in your owner’s manual). Make sure the car is in neutral in case you need to move it back or forward to get the hoist legs positioned properly. If you are not fortunate to have a two-post jack, you are not out of luck. You can use a hydraulic floor jack or ramps. When jacking up your car with a hydraulic floor jack, you will position the hydraulic floor jack directly under the pinch welds. CAUTION: ALWAYS USE SAFETY STANDS when lifting your vehicle with a hydraulic floor jack so it doesn’t slip of the pinch welds. When using ramps, just drive your vehicle up the ramps and make sure your put it in park and place a piece of wood or metal pipe behind the rear wheels so it doesn’t roll. 2 Get the tools ready. Tools needed to do an oil change on a 1999 Honda CRV are going to be; 17mil combination wrench or 17mil box end wrench doesn’t really matter, oil catcher, rags, oil filter remover tool, new oil filter #7317, and 4 liters of 5W-30 oil. WARNING ALWAYS GET THE SAME OIL AND OIL FILTER. 3 Locate oil cap. Open the cars hood, and locate the oil cap. The oil cap is usually black in color, has a symbol of an oil canister, and usually has what type of oil the car requires. Once you locate the oil cap remove it. Removing the oil cap will make the oil flow out of the oil pan more smoothly because there is no pressure build up. 4 Locate the oil pan. Once you lift the car up, you will locate the oil pan. The oil pan is usually flat with a plug coming out of it toward the bottom. One way of telling which is the oil pan and which isn’t is the oil pan is usually hot to the touch. 5 Remove the oil plug. Before you can remove the oil plug make sure you have the oil catcher underneath the oil pan. Once you have the oil catcher underneath the oil pan, remove the oil plug with the 17mil combination or box-end wrench. To remove the oil pan bolt you are going to turn the combination wrench to the left. Once you have it loosened, you can loosen it the remainder of the way with your fingers. 6 Re-install the oil plug. Once the old used oil has been completely drained out of the oil pan, you will re-install the oil plug. You will start the oil plug by hand until it doesn’t turn anymore, then you get the 17mil combination wrench and tighten it to the right but not to tight because you will begin to strip the threads of the oil pan causing it to leak in the future. 7 Locate the oil filter. The oil filter is usually located near the oil pan or above it. The oil filter is usually white in color unless it is on a Toyota it will have a black protector cover on it. To remove the oil filter on the 1999 Honda CRV you can use your hands, but if it is too tight you can use the oil filter remover tool. Just like the oil plug you will loosen the filter to the left. 8 Get the new oil filter ready The 1999 Honda CRV uses an oil filter with the part number 7317. Before installing it dip your finger into the oil and spread the oil onto the new oil filter seal. Also before installing the new oil filter make sure the old seal from the old oil filter is not stuck there. If the old seal is stuck there just remove it and install the new filter by hand. The reason why you tighten it by hand instead of using a tool is because it will get tighter from the heat. 9 Lower the vehicle. 10 Add the new oil. Add the specific oil your car needs. To know which oil your car needs you can find it in the owner’s manual with how much oil is needed for you car. For the 1999 Honda CRV it takes 4 liters of 5W 30 oil but its ok if you go a little over 4 Liters. If your cars oil looks very dark black in color you can add an additive called Lucas oil stabilizer. 11 Put back the oil cap. Put the oil cap back where you took it off from. Some oil caps make a \"clicking\" sound to let you know when it has been tightened all the way. 12 Start the car. Before you check the oil level you are going to have to start the car for around one minute to get the oil into the engine. Once you started the car for one minute turn it off and check the oil level if it is good don’t add any more oil, but if it below the full line add some oil. 13 Restart the oil light. On the 1999 Honda CRV restarting the oil light is very simple. The oil reset switch is located right in front of the speedometer. To reset it push the reset button and it.

Often owners or dealers do not readily disclose items such as previous repairs, weather damage or car finance history. In order to protect yourself when purchasing a used automobile, use these steps to check a car\u0027s history. Ad Steps 1 Research used cars online and in person at local dealers. Many local dealers can provide you with a car history report at their location. 2 When considering vehicles from different dealers, use an online resource to check the car\u0027s history. You can often obtain several car history reports for one low price. Check each site that you are considering purchasing the report from to determine the exact services offered. Most offer more than simply the car\u0027s finance history. They offer other services such as repair records, number of owners and whether the vehicle has been exposed to weather hazards such as floods. Check the site for the sources from which they receive their information to be sure that it is valid. Many of these sites obtain information from valid sources such as police and fire departments, collision repair shops, motor vehicle registration facilities and auto auctions, all of which are valid resources. If the sources are not reliable, do not use the site. 3 Using the car\u0027s VIN (Vehicle Identification Number) or Registration Number, go to the online site you have chosen and enter number. Check the displayed report for car finance history and other data that you wish to use in your decision. The VIN or Registration Number is generally found on the dashboard or on the driver\u0027s side of the vehicle. It is also included on insurance cards and the vehicle\u0027s registration card. 4 Print out a copy of each report and take to the dealer with you to assist in obtaining the best value for your money.

Check the car\u0027s history before taking it on a test drive. Although a car may seem desirable, its history may tell a different story. Pay close attention when test-driving a new car. Things like a musty smell could indicate that the car was involved in some type of flooding. Low mileage with a lot of wear on the inside may indicate that the odometer has been tampered with. Always try to examine a car in the daylight, especially when buying from an individual. In bad weather such as rain, dents and scratches can be easily overlooked. Hold registration certificate up to the light and check for watermark to ensure that it is a legal document. Check locks on the vehicle. If they are different, question the owner. It could indicate a stolen car. Warnings Never purchase a used car without checking its history. Never buy a vehicle if the owner does not have title to the vehicle. This could indicate that it is stolen.

Over time, a car’s ball joints may wear down. If a ball joint starts to loosen, you’ll hear clunking sounds from the front as the joint rattles in the socket. If it tightens up, the steering will bind so you can have a stiff spot as you turn the steering wheel. There may be a binding or squeaking sound in addition to the stiff spot. Fortunately, you can quickly and easily check your ball joints for excessive wear before you experience severe steering or suspension problems. Ad Steps A ball joint is basically like a ball-and-socket joint in your body, made of a housing, the ball, a cover cap, and some have a Belleville washer and/or spring. A Belleville washer is a cone shaped washer that keeps the joint center and under tension. Like a ball-and-socket joint, the joint gets worn out from stress after a long life and needs to be checked, especially if you notice a knocking sound during turns. Always defer to the owner\u0027s manual for more specific instructions and guidance. Auto manufacturers build different suspension set-ups, so read the manual to determine which type of ball joint your vehicle uses. Part 1 Checking Vehicles with Short Long Arm Suspension 1 Look for a wear indicator. While the vehicle is still on the ground, look underneath the car, on the bottom of the steering knuckle attached to the wheel. The most common indicator is a grease fitting that doubles as a wear indicator. That fitting, or boss, will stick out of the bottom of the joint’s housing by about half an inch (1.25 centimeters). As it wears the boss will recede into the housing. As long as the boss protrudes out, the joint should be fine. Once the boss is flush with the housing or has receded even further, you’ll need to replace the ball joint.[1] This applies to older cars. Most new cars do not have wear indicators, or a grease fitting. If you can’t find a wear indicator, or if the indicator doesn’t give you a clear enough sign, raise up the car to inspect the joint more thoroughly. 2 Raise the front end of the car. To check a loaded lower ball joint, the manufacturer will recommend that you place a jack under the lower control arm of the front wheel, as close to the ball joint as you can, then raise the vehicle until the wheel leaves the ground. If you don\u0027t do this, tension will still be on the ball joint when you jack up the car, making it difficult to move and look for play on the joint. Make sure there is no compression in the suspension when you check the ball joint. If you have control arms of unequal lengths, make sure the upper bump stop doesn’t touch the control arm. 3 Rock the wheels and check for play. Make sure your car is jacked securely. The vehicle must be on frame stands when jacked up and you are working on the vehicle. Move dial indicator to the side of the nut or to the side of the spindle and move the wheel in and out to check radial wear. For vertical play, place the dial indicator against the steering knuckle stud nut or the ball joint housing, depending on the manufacturer. Grab the wheel at the top and bottom (12 and 6 o’clock) to lift up and pull down. Move the dial gauge to the side of the nut and grab the tire at the bottom and move it in and out to check radial play of the joint. Read the dial indicator and check against the manufacturer’s specifications. If the movement is beyond specifications, replace the ball joint. Experienced mechanics will also just check play by the feel, listening closely for any clicking or easy motion that suggests the ball joint is worn out. Alternatively, you could have a helper look closely at the joint itself to see if it appears loose as you move it. Part 2 Checking Vehicles with McPherson Strut Suspension 1 Look for the grease fitting. If your front suspension uses McPherson struts, look for a wear indicator, which is usually a grease fitting. Grasp the fitting and try to wiggle it. If the fitting moves around inside the housing, you’ll need to replace the ball joint. 2 Jack up the car on the front cross-member. Many front wheel drive cars with strut suspensions should not be jacked up using the lower control arm, so it\u0027s a good idea to consult your owner\u0027s manual before attempting to inspect the joint. In general, you\u0027re going to want to jack the car up in the directed place as you normally would, on the crossing member of the frame. Let the McPherson struts extend as far out as you can before you try to check the wheels for play. 3 Use your hand to check the up-down play on the ball joint. Rock the lower part of the wheel around to see if there is any play in the joint. If there is any play in the joint, it must be replaced. 4 Listen. The ball joint assembly in a vehicle with strut suspension should be silent. Any clicking sound when you move it up indicates it\u0027s worn out and not working smoothly as it should. If you notice significant play, you need to change the ball joint. Alternatively, have someone look at the ball joint while you attempt to move it. It\u0027ll shudder slightly and look insecure if it needs to be replaced.

Visual inspections may prevent an accident caused by a blown tire, and many other potential hazards. Ad Steps Method 1 Short Trips 1 Check under the car for obvious leaks. Driving with leaking fluid may cause failure of the steering, brakes or radiator. 2 Check the tires for proper inflation and any obvious damage or signs of excessive wear. In a worst case scenario, a blown tire could cause you to crash. 3 Ask someone to stand behind your car to check the lights. Turn on the car and activate the directional signals, then apply the brakes and put the car in reverse so the person can see if lights are working correctly. Ask the person to stand in front of the vehicle, then turn on the headlights and activate the directional signals. 4 Check the back seat or seats to make sure no one is hiding there. Carjackers sometimes hide in the back seat, then surprise the driver once the car is started. 5 Check your windows to make sure you have good visibility. Check mirrors to be sure they are aligned properly, giving you a proper view of the road. 6 Know how the gauges on your dashboard should look when everything is working properly. Check the gauges every time you start your car. Check the engine temperature gauge after the engine has had time to warm. 7 Check the vents, heating system and air conditioning to be sure they are in working order so you can can defog or defrost the windows when necessary. Method 2 Long Trips 1 Check fluids in the car periodically. Check the oil weekly. Check the brake and power steering fluids and engine coolant transmission fluids monthly or before a long trip to be sure they are full. Check fluids when the engine is cold. Fill the wiper fluid if necessary. Read the owner\u0027s manual for directions on how to check the fluids. Engine fluid levels—including oil, brake fluid and power steering fluids—are easy to check via dipsticks found under the hood. Engine coolant is visible in a plastic container apart from the radiator on newer vehicles. 2 Have the battery tested before a trip. Although you can take have the battery tested by a mechanic, you can check for obvious signs of corrosion on the terminals or for signs of cracks or leaks. Have the battery fixed or replaced immediately if you find anything wrong. 3 Activate your windshield wipers and sprayer to be certain they work. 4 Check your air filter before a long trip, as it can affect fuel efficiency and engine performance. 5 Make sure the spare tire is inflated and serviceable and the jack is present. It\u0027s a good idea to check them periodically even if you aren\u0027t going on a long trip.

Assessing past damage will help you determine the real value of the car and detect resulting problems that could result. Here are some tips on how to detect auto accident damage. Ad Steps 1 Obtain a vehicle history report. Use a vehicle history research company like Carfax to get a full report on the car\u0027s history. This file will contain a list of all past owners, insurance information and any accident reports or claims filed involving the vehicle. This will help you know what kind of damage to look for when physically inspecting the car. 2 Look for fender and bumper cracks. Examine both ends of the vehicle and look for any cracks or patched areas. Fenders and bumpers break easily in a collision because they are often made of lightweight or plastic composite material. Breakage or repairs to the fender or bumper is a good indicator of further car accident damage. 3 Check the windshield. Look at all windows and the front and back windshields of the car to check for vehicle accident damage. Note any chips, cracks or webbing. This could indicate that the car was involved in a collision and these areas will definitely require repairs. 4 Assess the car\u0027s body lines. Crouch down at one end of the car so you\u0027re eye level with the body of the car. Look along the main line down the side of the car\u0027s body. This line should be straight and even and the car\u0027s paint should reflect normally. An uneven line or distorted reflection indicates that body panels of the car have been replaced or hammered out due to body damage. 5 Examine panel and door gaps. Look at the gaps between each door and the adjoining body panel. The gaps should be straight and an even width from top to bottom. A car that has had auto accident damage will have uneven gaps due to misalignment or replaced panels or doors. 6 Feel the body for filler spots. Run the palm of your hand down the body panels of the car and around the corners of the fender and bumper. A car with accident damage will have bumps or uneven spots from filler used to repair damaged areas. 7 Check for clamp marks. Clamp marks around the frame of the car indicate that the car has been on a frame machine, so the car has likely sustained damage that required major repairs to the car\u0027s body after an accident. 8 Look for repainting. Look closely along the edges of the car\u0027s doors and body panels for any nicks, scratches or uneven paint areas. Signs of a different color paint underneath could mean that the car has been repainted after an accident or that a door or panel was replaced and repainted to match the rest of the car.

It makes sure the engine is up to factory specs and is working efficiently. Ad Steps 1 Gather the tools required to complete the compression test. You will need a ratchet, spark plug socket, and a compression tester which you can easily rent from any auto parts store. You will also need some sort of repair manual, Haynes, Etc. 2 Once all tools are gathered, find a place in which you would be performing the compression test, driveway, garage, etc. As well as the vehicle in which you would be doing the test on. Once you obtain the place and all the tools, and the vehicle, let the vehicle get up to operational temperature. NOTE: You do not want to do a compression test on a cold engine, metal expands when hot and allows everything to fully operate. This way all the parts expand on heat and keep a better compression. 3 Once vehicle has reached operational temperature shut the engine off, and open up the hood of the car, Use caution as to motor will be warm and certain components could burn skin on contact, Such as exhaust manifold. Once the hood of the car is open locate the spark plugs. There will be four of them since this is a 4 cylinder motor, and all four of them will be sitting on top of the vale cover 4 Remove all of the spark plugs from the engine 5 Disconnect the primary wires from the distributor and make sure the main harness coming from the distributor is disconnected from the motor. NOTE- Doing this will eliminate shock when doing test! 6 Install the compression gauge in the number one spark plug hole. Make sure the gauge can rest somewhere safe where it will not fall while you are cranking the car. 7 Crank the engine over at least six compression strokes. Make sure you have a (WOT) \" throttle should be wide open\". You should be able to count how many times the motor tries to turn over. This is known as compression strokes. Once you let it turn over, turn the key off and check the gauge. 8 Record what the gauge reads and proceed this for each cylinder head/ spark plug hole. 9 Once finished with all four readings compare the readouts with each cylinder. The readings should be no more or less than 20% of the others. The readings should be anywhere from 155+ across the board, depending on mileage. 10 If the compression is high, the combustion chambers are probably built up with carbon deposits, if the case, then the cylinder head needs to be removed and de-carbonized 11 If the compression is lower, or varies greatly between cylinders, perform a leak down test, or have a shop perform one. This will show exactly where leaking is occurring and how bad it is. 12 Once test is finished, make sure you screw all four spark plugs back in, and hook up the distributor harness back to the engine. Double check everything is plugged back in before you attempt to start the vehicle!

When a potentially dangerous current surge occurs, the wire running through the fuse \"blows\" and cuts the connection to the circuit. This is great for protecting your car or home electrical system, but inconvenient in the short term. Armed with the right tool and a little knowledge, you\u0027ll be able to check your fuses quickly when this happens and find out whether you need a replacement. Ad Steps Part 1 Locating the Fuse Box 1 Check your car manual or look in likely places. Many cars have two fuse boxes, and there\u0027s no universal standard for where they are placed. You\u0027ll save time if you can refer to your car\u0027s manual (or find the manual online), look up the location of the fuse that controls the part of the car that lost power, and check it directly. If you don\u0027t have the manual, check these common locations for a large box, or a group of exposed fuses:[1] Most cars have one or two fuse boxes under the hood, next to the engine or battery. There may also be a fuse box inside the car, so keep looking if the fuse you\u0027re looking for isn\u0027t here, or if all the fuses here are fine. Newer cars often have a fuse box underneath the dash in an easily accessible location. Check the ceiling of the glove box for a hinge that swings downward. You may need a flat-head screwdriver to open the lid. Older cars often have their fuses in an open box to the left of the brake pedal or the foot-operated parking brake. It\u0027s difficult to examine the fuses closely in some models, so bring a flashlight and/or hand mirror. Less commonly, the fuse box is located in the trunk or under the rear seat.[2] 2 Look for indoor fuse boxes. If you are checking the fuses in your home, look for a fuse box or circuit box in closets, basements, laundry rooms, or on the outside wall of the house. If you live in an apartment or shared home, the fuse box may be located in a neighbor\u0027s apartment. 3 Check the user\u0027s manual for other devices. If you are checking the fuses in a central air conditioning unit or another appliance, check the user manual to find out where they are. For some appliances, you may need to shut off the power to the device before you can safely access the fuse box. Part 2 Checking Visual Signs 1 Read the labels if present. Car fuse boxes often have a diagram on the outside or inside lid, and always in the car\u0027s user manual. This can save you a lot of time, since you can check the one fuse that protects the radio (or other nonfunctional system) instead of all 40+ fuses. Home fuse boxes are often unlabeled, but typically only have a few fuses, so it\u0027s easy to test them all Find your car\u0027s user manual or fuse box diagram online here or with a general online search. You\u0027ll need to know the make and model of your car. 2 Leave the fuse connected. Don\u0027t remove the fuse yet, as this can be dangerous if the power is still connected, and can cause minor problems to connected systems if you remove a still-functioning fuse. Instead, look closely at each fuse while they are in place. 3 Check for broken wires or scorch marks. A fuse can look completely normal and still be blown (and in need of replacement), but more often than not there will be a visual sign that will guide you to the problem fuse. Fuses come in three basic forms: Transparent cylinders (glass or plastic) have a wire running through the middle. If the wire is broken, the fuse is blown. If the whole cylinder is scorched black or brown, the fuse is blown and there may be a major short on the circuit that needs repair (especially if the replacement fuse blows after a short time). The two-pronged chip fuses often used in cars have a U-shaped wire running between the prongs, inside the plastic. If the wire is broken, the fuse is blown, but it\u0027s often difficult to tell. Opaque cylinders (covered by a solid metal coating) must be tested by other means. 4 Turn off power and remove an indoor fuse. If checking an indoor fuse, you can turn off the main power to the house and remove the fuse to get a closer look. For any type of fuse, if you are still unsure, you can move on to the next section. If you have identified the problem fuse, skip ahead to replacing the fuse. This step is not recommended at this stage for car fuses, since removing the wrong fuse can negatively affect idling performance, diagnostic information, or accessories.[3] Part 3 Testing the Circuit With a Test Light 1 Purchase a modern test light. You can purchase this tool at a hardware store or electronics store. Select a \"computer safe\" model with an LED light in the handle, or with an incandescent bulb powered by a battery or power outlet. Never test car wiring with an old-style test light with an incandescent bulb that draws power from the circuit, or you could trigger the airbags and cause massive damage.[4] Alternatively, if you have a multimeter, skip down to the instructions below to use it instead. 2 Check the fuse with the test light. Follow these steps to check the fuse with a test light:[5] Clamp the black grounding lead to an electrically conductive object (such as anything metal). Turn the ignition to run, or make sure the main power supply is on if testing a house fuse. Touch the red probe near one end of the fuse, then the other. (For small two-pronged fuses, the two prongs are the two ends of the fuse.) 3 Interpret the results. If the fuse is good, the bulb in the test light will light up both times. If it does not light up on one end, the fuse is blown and needs to be replaced.[6] If neither end lights up, there is no current running to the fuse box, or your black lead is not grounded, or the light bulb has burned out. Correct this problem and try again, or use a multimeter instead. With a Multimeter 1 Turn off the power and remove the fuse. Turn off the ignition to the car, or the power leading to the home fuse box. Pry the fuse out on one end, then the other. You may need tweezers or needle-nose pliers to remove the fuse, or a similar tool sometimes attached to the lid of automobile fuse boxes. If you plan on testing more than one fuse in a car\u0027s fuse box, take a photograph first so you know exactly where each fuse goes. 2 Test continuity if available. Most digital multimeters have a continuity setting, which is labeled with a series of parallel arcs: ))). Turn the dial to this setting, then place the two probes at opposite ends of the fuse. If you hear a constant beep while they are touching the fuse, the fuse is still good. If you don\u0027t hear anything, the fuse is blown. If your multimeter has no continuity option, or you would like to double-check the result, continue on to test resistance. 3 Set the multimeter to test resistance. This setting looks like the Greek letter omega: ?. The resistance setting sends a small current through the fuse, and tests how much current goes through. We don\u0027t really care about the exact resistance reading, but if the fuse is blown, we won\u0027t get any resistance reading because the current will not be able to pass through the broken wire. If you have an analog multimeter, there are multiple ? settings. Choose the one that says ?x1.[7] Old models sometimes say Rx1 instead. 4 Touch the two probes to each other. Touch the two metal probes together and look at the multimeter display. This number (or needle position) is what the multimeter currently \"thinks\" is a resistance of 0. If we get a result near this number when testing the fuse, the fuse is still good. Your multimeter probably has a dial (analog multimeters) or a button (digital) that lets you calibrate this back to 0. You can do this if you plan on using the multimeter a lot, but it\u0027s not necessary for this task. 5 Touch the probes to each end of the fuse. Touch one probe to each end of the fuse, while looking at the display. If the display doesn\u0027t change when you touch the fuse, the fuse is blown and needs to be replaced. If the number or needle position moves to a similar position to the one you saw when both probes were touching, then the fuse is still good and can be popped back into the fuse box. Part 4 Replacing a Fuse 1 Turn off the power and remove the fuse. Whenever you are removing a fuse or putting in a new one, make sure the power supply to the fuse box is off. For a car, this means turning off the ignition. 2 Find a new fuse. These are available at hardware stores, electronic shops, or auto supply stores (for car fuses). Bring along your old, blown fuse so you can compare the size and other characteristics, as described below. 3 Select a new fuse of the same amp rating, type, and shape. Replacing a fuse with the exact same type of fuse is very important. Most importantly, check the amp rating, normally a number written on the fuse, and purchase a replacement fuse with the same rating. Each fuse is designed to blow at a specific number of amps; this is its entire purpose. If you use too low an amp rating, the fuse might blow during normal use and short the circuit. If you use too high an amp rating, the fuse won\u0027t blow during a power surge, and the less replaceable parts of the circuit will be damaged instead. Transparent, cylindrical fuses come in two types: fast-blow (a straight wire), or slow-blow (a coiled wire). Don\u0027t put in a slow-blow unless the old fuse was also a slow-blow, or the fuse may not be able to prevent damage quickly enough.[8] 4 Pop in the new fuse. Modern fuses should pop in easily with a little pressure. Old, glass fuses sometimes need to have one end pushed in first, then the other.[9] Reader Questions and Answers Unanswered Questions What are the types of fuses in apartments?

If a blown fuse is preventing your car from working, but you need to drive to pick up a new fuse, consult your car\u0027s manual and remove a fuse with the same ampere rating from a nonessential system, such as the radio. Put it in place of the broken fuse.[10] If the replacement fuse blows shortly after installation, and you\u0027re sure you used the correct amp rating, there could be a more serious issue with your electrical system. Consult an electrician.[11] Warnings Make sure that the power is turned off to the equipment before testing any fuse or removing any fuse, unless you are using a test light.

It\u0027s one of the most straightforward bits of regular maintenance you can perform in your vehicle, important especially before long trips that will involve heavy engine use. You can learn to locate the right gauges in your engine compartment, diagnose problems with the oil in your car, and address those concerns if necessary. Ad Steps Part 1 Finding the Dipstick 1 Refer to your owner\u0027s manual. Mobil One and other oil manufacturers recommend checking engine oil levels before driving your vehicle, when the oil is still cold.[1] However, some manufacturers will recommend checking the oil after you\u0027ve warmed up the engine, so check your owner\u0027s manual to find the specific recommendations for your vehicle.[2] You want the oil to be in the oil pan, not in the engine as it will be while you\u0027re driving. Immediately after driving, the oil level will appear lower, making it easier to overfill the oil. If you want to check the oil and have been driving the vehicle, wait five or ten minutes to let it settle into the oil pan before checking it. In very cold weather, it may be appropriate to drive the car around a bit first to get the oil loosened up and less viscous before checking it. Let the engine run for a few minutes, then let it cool down for five before you check it. Many people disagree about whether or not the oil should be checked hot or cold. Some manufacturers recommend checking engine oil warm, and it\u0027s perfectly fine to do so as long as you\u0027re looking at the right line. There will appear to be \"less\" oil on the gauge when the oil is colder, but the oil will thin out as the vehicle runs up to normal operating temperature. Synthetic oil expands more when it is hot than \"regular\" oil does, so it may be best to check your oil cold if you use synthetic oil. Talk to your mechanic if you aren\u0027t sure. 2 Park the car on a flat even surface. To get an accurate reading, you\u0027ll also need to make sure the oil isn\u0027t sloshed to one side of the pan, which can give you a slightly inaccurate reading.[3] Try to find a relatively flat surface on which to park and check your oil. 3 Pop the hood. Usually, there will be a latch somewhere at the foot of the driver side door that looks like the front of your car opening up. You\u0027ll pull or push this latch, depending on the make and model of the vehicle. Then, you\u0027ll need to exit the car and look under the front of the hood for a latch, usually at the center but sometimes slightly off-center. Pull this and raise the hood to examine the engine.[4] On some cars, the hood will stay up, while on others it will require a prop rod, which is usually folded up on the front or side of the engine compartment. Lift this support into place (there will be an opening on the hood to insert it) and let go of the hood. 4 Locate the dipstick. On most cars, the oil dipstick will have a red, orange, or yellow cap. It\u0027s a circular or rectangular shape, and should be pointing out directly from the engine block, to one side or the other.[5] Some vehicles, such as Hondas and some Fords, may have the dipstick point out directly from the top of the valve cover. Oil dipsticks are typically located towards the passenger side or near the front and are usually inserted into a dipstick guide about the size of a pencil. On most cars, there should also be a symbol that looks like an old-style oil can to demarcate the proper dipstick. When you\u0027ve located the dipstick, you\u0027re ready to remove it and check the oil. Most automatic transmission vehicles will have two dipsticks under the hood, one for the oil and one for the transmission fluid. Transmission dipsticks are typically found at the rear of the engine bay or towards the driver\u0027s side, and the dipstick will commonly be inserted into a slightly larger tube. This transmission fluid is typically pink or red. Never confuse the two. Never put oil into the transmission, which can cost you serious money. 5 Get some paper towels or an old rag. When you check your oil, it\u0027s important that you have a couple of paper towels or some other cloth that you can use to wipe it off and check the consistency of the oil. Paper towels usually work best, because it gives you a nice white backdrop contrast to examine the color. Also a great way to keep your hands clean. Part 2 Checking the Oil 1 Remove the dipstick. Most dipsticks range from a foot to three feet, and you\u0027ll need to check the very tip to get the reading you\u0027re looking for. Slowly pull the dipstick out, holding a paper towel around the port as you pull, to wipe the oil off and keep it from flipping up and out. You shouldn\u0027t have to pull very hard or twist on most oil dipsticks, but you might have to use a little bit of strength to get it to come free. Once you\u0027ve got the cap off, it should pull free quite easily. Don\u0027t force it. 2 Examine the color and quality of the oil. The color and the consistency of engine oil is indicative of its age, and possibly of other engine efficiency issues that you might need to address. As soon as you remove the dipstick, you can get a good sense of the quality of the oil in your engine. Engine oil that\u0027s in good condition should look slightly yellow-greenish on the rag, and shouldn\u0027t be super-dark. Wipe the oil off the end of the dipstick and examine it on the rag.[6] Oil will change in color from golden or amber colored to brown and black as more and more particulate gets in the oil from the engine. Metal filings and particulate will slowly scrape the cylinders of your engine over time, which is why the oil needs to be changed according to the manufacturer\u0027s recommended service interval (check your owner\u0027s manual or service booklet to find your vehicle\u0027s service interval). Look at the color, specifically. Does it look brackish, or chunky? Does it look black or dark? If so, it\u0027s likely a sign that your oil needs changed. Take the car in to have it serviced, or change the oil yourself. 3 Dry off the dipstick and dip it once more into the hole. The first time you pull the dipstick out, you can\u0027t learn much about the amount of oil, since the dipstick will have oil stuck on it at many different points. Once you pull out the dipstick and examine the color, wipe off the end and reinsert it into the hole, then pull it back out immediately to get a good reading on the amount.[7] 4 Check the amount of oil. There should be two small dots on the end of most dipsticks, and one corresponds to the maximum fill line in the oil pan and the other refers to the minimum. The minimum dot should be close to the tip, and the maximum should be about an inch or so up from that on the dipstick. In a properly filled car that\u0027s cool, the line should be just about halfway between the two points. In general, the \"minimum\" marker should be close to the very dip of the dipstick. If the line of oil on the dipstick is between the tip and that mark, you need to add oil to the car. The oil should never be higher than the maximum fill point, though it will be close to that point when the oil is hot. If it is, you may need to drain some oil from your car. Part 3 Adding Oil 1 Check your user manual. Before you try to add oil, you need to find out what kind of oil your car requires. It\u0027s important to always check, because the types vary, even from one model and season to another. It\u0027s generally unwise to mix different grades of oil, so check carefully with the manual or your local mechanic before you add oil to the car. Alternatively, you can also talk with the staff at most auto supply stores to figure out what kind of oil you need to put in your car. As long as you know the make and the model, they should be able to look it up and tell you, or you can look it up yourself in the manual in the oil section. 2 Locate the oil fill cap located on top of your engine. These caps are typically well marked with the words \"Oil Fill\" and sometimes with the grade of engine oil your vehicle uses. If you see 5w30, for example, written on the cap, you\u0027ll know what kind of oil you need to add. Remove the cap, wipe it off with a paper towel or the rag you\u0027ve been using, and insert a clean funnel. You need to use a funnel to add engine oil, or you\u0027ll risk spilling it all over the engine block, which will burn off and create a terrible smell, and possibly worse problems. 3 Add the appropriate oil in small increments. It\u0027s important to allow time for the additional oil to drain down into the oil pan. It should fill it up the funnel suddenly and then glug down slowly. Avoid overfilling the funnel. If you spill a little bit of oil on the engine compartment, don\u0027t panic. Spilled oil tends not to be super-dangerous, though it will smell bad and may smoke some. Try to wipe it up as best you can with a rag or a towel. 4 Check the oil again. Remove the dipstick and check the level. Repeat this process until the appropriate amount of oil is showing on the dipstick. Wipe the stick off after each read. Once you have finished, double check that the dipstick is fully seated and the oil fill cap has been tightened. Double check any other locations you have checked, remove any rags, paper towels or oil bottles. Lower the hood prop and close the hood.

Mark each wire with masking tape so you can put them back on the correct plugs later. 4 Remove all the spark plugs and block the carburetor throttle so that it is fully opened. 5 Thread the compression gauge into a cylinder making sure that the pressure release button has been pushed and the reading is at 0. 6 Crank the engine for about 2 seconds and write down the highest reading from the gauge. Be sure to turn the engine over six to eight times, same for each cylinder. It is helpful to have a friend who can crank the engine. Compression readings should be high compression (over 100 pounds) and relatively uniform among the cylinders (within 5 pounds). Variations from cylinder to cylinder should be no more than 14 to 20 pounds. 7 Recheck cylinders with low compression readings by injecting approximately 10cc of engine oil into the cylinder through the spark plug hole. If the compression reading increases a little, the problem is probably worn, broken, or poorly seated piston rings. If the compression reading remains the same, leaking or damaged valves may be at fault. 8 Return the spark plugs. Use the 6\" rubber breather hose as an extension to hand-thread the plug into its hole. Turn the spark plug a turn or so to ensure it is not cross threaded. 9 Reattached the spark plug wires.

CV joints are protected by plastic or rubber boots that hold in the grease the joints are packed in. If the boot fails, dirt and moisture displace the grease, impairing the joint. Inspecting the CV boots at the first sign of trouble can help save the CV joints and money in repairs. Ad Steps 1 Park the car on a level surface. This isn\u0027t for the sake of the CV boots or joints, but for your own safety. 2 Slide under the front of the car as far as possible.

Before you do so, you should check your car to make sure that it is in good condition and running smooth. This will help you to drive safe and avoid any breakdowns or mechanical issues. Then you\u0027ll be free to just roll down the windows, turn on the radio and enjoy the open road! Don\u0027t forget the coffee! Ad Steps 1 Check the fluids in your car. Checking the oil, coolant, brake fluid and windscreen wash levels may help you avoid an accident or an unnecessary breakdown. Also check the levels for the clutch fluid (often the same as brake fluid) and power steering fluid (if fitted to your car). Refer to your owner\u0027s manual to see where fluid reservoirs are located. 2 Check your air pressure. These should be printed in the owner\u0027s manual or a sticker on the body where the driver\u0027s door shuts. The pressure marked on the side of the tire is the max, which must not be exceeded. Also, don\u0027t forget to check your spare tire pressure. Often neglected, not doing so will turn a bad time into a worse one if the spare is unusable. 3 Get the oil changed before you leave if it\u0027s almost time for a change. A long trip can put additional stress on your motor. Don\u0027t think that adding extra oil by yourself will work like an oil change, because that does not get rid of the sludge from old used oil. You may not realize this due to the fact that you are continuously adding new, cleaner oil which makes it appear as if it is clean oil. When changing your car\u0027s oil, you must always replace the oil filter at the same time. 4 Check your tire wear by using a penny or tread gauge. Ensure you have at least 1/16th\" or 1.6mm tread left. If the tread is less than 1/12\" or 2.5mm, consider replacing your tires for very long journeys as they will wear down more quickly. Tires heat up on long trips which can cause blowouts on worn out tires. 5 Check your car\u0027s air filter. A plentiful supply of clean air to your engine improves the vehicle\u0027s performance and efficiency. Also check and change your car\u0027s cabin (pollen) filter if it has one, as these are often ignored in services and, if worn, adversely affect the quality of air in the cabin. 6 Wash your car. At the minimum, clean the windows of your car for the best visibility. Also check the condition of your wiper blades and replace them if necessary. 7 Check to be certain that all lights and signals are functional on your car. You may need the help of another person for this. Sit in the car, turn on each light or signal and ask your friend to tell you if it is working or not. Replace bulbs as necessary. Also consider carrying spare bulbs on a road trip (at least one for each light eg. headlights, indicators, tail lights, reverse lights). Changing bulbs (especially front) can take time in modern cars, so don\u0027t leave this to the last minute if bulbs need changing. Occasionally, lights may not work because a fuse needs replacing. Consider checking your headlights alignment (using a white garage door or inside a garage) and adjusting the alignment if it is incorrect as poor headlight alignment will reduce visibility at night, especially on unlit roads. 8 Ensure that you have all emergency equipment inside your car, and that everything works properly. Emergency equipment includes: an up-to-date map, cell phone, spare tire (alternatively a puncture repair kit, although this is not ideal) and emergency tools (e.g. flashlight, screwdrivers, pliers and an adjustable spanner).

But consumers need to be aware because many of these warranties are aggressively marketed and grossly overpriced.[1][2] It\u0027s important to evaluate your auto warranty needs and know how to choose an extended auto warranty that meets your requirements without spending money on services or coverage you don\u0027t really need. Ad Steps 1 Decide if you need an extended warranty at all. According to checkbook.org, you\u0027re probably better off without one. They claim that a $1000 warranty typically only pays out $250 in repairs, with the rest going to marketing and overhead. [3] 2 Know if you\u0027re leasing or buying. You may not need extensive warranty coverage on a vehicle you\u0027re leasing for a year or two. Let warranty representatives know this information up front and ask if they have warranty options specific to leased vehicles. 3 Base your coverage on the life of the car. If you\u0027re going to be driving your car for several years, you will probably have to perform major repairs, like engine or transmission service. If you replace your car before the warranty expires, you may get a partial refund, but this is not ideal as most of the value of the warranty comes from repairs made at the end of its term as the vehicle ages. 4 Do your homework before purchasing. Gather all the information you need to select an extended auto warranty package before you purchase the car. Planning ahead will help you avoid being pressured into coverage you don\u0027t need. It can also help you avoid penalties or extra charges assessed for adding warranties after the date of purchase. 5 Ask about manufacturer-specific warranties. Most major auto manufacturers offer brand-specific warranties that cover more extensive repairs than private or after-market warranty vendors. Ask your auto dealer about brand-specific or manufacturer warranties available for your vehicle and compare all your warranty options. 6 Ask how it works. Depending on the type of warranty you purchase, you may be able to have your car serviced at any authorized dealer or you may be required to take it back to the dealer or lot where you purchased it. Ask about this requirement so you know what restrictions you will have to get service and maintenance covered under the extended warranty. Read the contract carefully. Many contracts don\u0027t cover certain types of common repairs. 7 Find out about up-front costs. Ask your warranty representative to explain the process of obtaining service coverage under your chosen extended warranty package. Some warranties will pay the mechanic directly, while others will require you to pay up front and submit a bill for reimbursement. Consider which process will work better for your financial situation before choosing an extended auto warranty. 8 Inquire about upgrades. You might choose one level of coverage and determine later that you need more coverage. Find out if the warranty you choose offers coverage upgrades or if you\u0027ll be locked into one level for the life of the warranty. 9 Review the financial stability of the company backing the warranty. Your service plan is worthless if the company goes out of business before you need to file a claim. Look for an A- or better rating from A.M. Best.

Ideally, the color of your car should not only reflect your personality, but also increase your safety on the road or even hide dust and dirt. Instead of choosing a color on the spur of the moment, or based on what\u0027s available on the lot, consider the impact of multiple factors, and select a color that fits with your most important needs and preferences. Ad Steps 1 Identify what colors are considered \"safest.\" You may feel drawn to a bold color like red, and that\u0027s certainly an attention-grabbing hue, but it may end up costing you money. Some statistics show that red cars are involved in more accidents and are more likely to pulled over by police. Some insurance companies may charge higher premiums for colors considered \"risky,\" but may charge lower premiums for colors deemed safer. White, for example, is more visible at night than other colors. Even safer than white may be silver, which is also highly visible. It\u0027s estimated that silver cars are involved in 50 percent fewer injury accidents than even white cars. 2 Research the emotional and psychological impact of color, and consider the image you want to project with your car. Do you want to stand out? Be seen as sophisticated? Or would you rather blend in and not be noticed? Every color conveys a specific emotion or image, both to the driver and to other motorists. Want to grab attention? Go for red. Want to project an image of wealth and class? Consider black. Or, if you just want to keep a low profile on the road, opt for a neutral color like beige or tan. 3 Seek authenticity in your choice of paint color if you\u0027re repainting a classic or vintage car and historical accuracy is important to you. Auto paint colors have changed slightly over the years, and what\u0027s popular now may not fit a car from another decade. These shades may be more difficult to track down, but are essential if you have a classic car you plan to show. 4 Find out what colors are the most popular. Just as in any other area, from fashion to interior design, trends in car colors come and go. Researching what\u0027s currently \"hot\" for car colors can alert you to new colors, give you an idea of what\u0027s the most common and help you generate ideas for how you want your car to look. You may wish to stick with what\u0027s currently \"in,\" or you may use this information to choose a color that will set you apart. 5 Match the color to the style of car. The model of your car is an especially important factor. Bright colors like red and yellow looks great on a sports car, but may clash with the more conservative style of a sedan, for example. Try to find a color that not only reflects your personality, but also fits the kind of car you drive.

Since the fabric of your car\u0027s ceiling is glued to the roof, you should be sure to use safe cleaning methods and products that will keep the glue and laminate intact. Continue reading this article to learn more about the proper methods for cleaning your car\u0027s ceiling in a safe and efficient manner. Ad Steps 1 Loosen dirt and grime from your car\u0027s ceiling using a microfiber cloth. A microfiber cloth is made from materials that will lift and collect the majority of loose dust, dirt, and grime from your car\u0027s ceiling. Use a dry, clean microfiber cloth to gently rub the ceiling of your car in the direction of the grain in the headliner fabric. 2 Purchase an upholstery cleaner or shampoo to use on your car\u0027s ceiling. The upholstery cleaner should be compatible with and safe to use on the ceiling\u0027s fabric type. For example, if your car\u0027s ceiling is made from vinyl, purchase a vinyl cleaner. Visit a local retail store that specializes in auto parts and products to locate an upholstery cleaner that is safe to use on the ceiling fabric in your car. 3 Spray the upholstery cleaner across the entire surface of your car\u0027s ceiling. An upholstery shampoo or cleaner will remove any dust, dirt, and grime that the microfiber cloth was previously unable to remove. 4 Gently rub the entire surface of your car\u0027s ceiling using the microfiber cloth. After the upholstery cleaner has worked itself into the headliner fabric, the microfiber cloth will remove any leftover stains, dirt, dust, and other grime. 5 Remove grease stains from your car\u0027s ceiling using a water and vinegar mixture. A mixture of 3 parts water and 1 part distilled white vinegar will remove grease stains from the headliner without affecting the glue and laminate that attaches the fabric to the ceiling. Saturate a clean microfiber cloth with the water and vinegar mixture, then gently rub the cloth against the grease stain for removal. 6 Wait for your car\u0027s ceiling to dry completely before applying more upholstery cleaner. If your car\u0027s ceiling remains dirty after the first application of upholstery cleaner, the fabric must dry completely to prevent the wet glue from detaching the headliner fabric from the car\u0027s ceiling. 7 Lightly spray air freshener or orange oil onto your car\u0027s ceiling if odors remain. Products such as these can help remove unpleasant smells such as cigarette smoke or food smells from the headliner. Refrain from saturating the fabric of the car ceiling with air fresheners, as some air fresheners may contain chemicals that can eat away at the glue keeping the headliner fabric attached to the ceiling. 8 Finished.

The substances pass through a catching system, which gives them time to cool off and solidify, and the water passes through the drain as normal. This system must be maintained regularly in order to work effectively in keeping your grease trap clean. When done correctly, learning how to clean a grease trap will save you ample amounts of money for your business. Ad Steps 1 Detach the lid from the grease trap gently with a pry bar. Be sure to go slowly through this process, as there are gaskets for the grease trap located just under the cover. If you damage these, you will have to spend money to replace them. 2 Inspect the grease trap\u0027s parts once the lid is removed. You will be removing and replacing parts during cleaning, and you need to know where the components are located and how to install them to put them back in properly. For better results, it may help to draw a diagram of the trap\u0027s interior so that you can refer to during the re-installation process. 3 Insert a wooden dowel or measuring stick into the grease trap. Gently guide it to the bottom of the trap, and swirl it lightly in the trap so that the grease and oils mark the dowel. This can provide you with a guide to how much debris is in the trap. Remove the dowel, and use a tape measure to determine how many inches of waste are present. Record the results in a FOG (fatty oils and grease) pump out report, which is issued by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 4 Use a small bucket to remove any standing water from the tank of your grease trap. If you prefer, you can store the water in a larger bucket or trash bin, and pour it back into the drain after collecting the waste. 5 Remove the waste from your grease trap with the small bucket. Scoop the bucket in to the trap, and bring out the solidified waste. Place the waste in a water-tight container, such as a heavy-duty plastic trash bag. 6 Scrape down the lid and the sides of the trap with your bucket. Remove any large pieces of fat or oils that are attached to the trap. To achieve an even cleaner trap, you can use a wet/dry vacuum to suck out any smaller bits of waste. 7 Clean the lids, trap sides, and parts with soap and room-temperature water. Use a steel pot scrubber to remove excess waste and odor. Flush the screens and parts with water to remove the soap and debris. 8 Re-install the grease traps parts by following your diagram. Replace the lid once all the parts are secured and working. 9 Copy your FOG report for your records. Mail the original to the address listed on the report.

Ask it here: Submit Video Tips An alternative technology, the Grease Recovery Device does not require grease trap pumping or cleaning. Recovered grease does not go landfill. It is recyclable for future biodiesel use with the waste vegetable oil from a restaurant\u0027s deep-fryer. Wait until the day before trash pickup in your area to clean the traps. This will minimize the time the waste must sit in your garbage, thereby also minimizing the odor. A mask is recommended due to the rancid odors of the grease trap. For optimal results, you should perform a vigorous cleaning a minimum of every 90 days. This will have multiple benefits, including minimizing foul odors emanating from the trap, preventing it from overflowing into your business or the street, and guaranteeing its effectiveness. Grease trap cleaning should be a regular part of your facility\u0027s maintenance routine. The EPA requires that these traps remain clutter-free and functional. Failure to comply is a criminal offense in most locations. There are many different methods available for disposal of grease trap waste. Rather than to just throw the debris in the garbage, which goes to a dump, consider available alternatives, such as companies that recycle the waste into usable bio fuel, garbage companies that use special disposal techniques for fatty liquids, oils, or grease. Never use grease trap additives including bacteria or enzymes. These products push the grease from the trap into the sanitary sewer. The grease eventually re hardens and causes severe grease blockages. Grease trap additives are illegal in most states and every province throughout Canada. Fats, oils, and grease (FOG) are lighter than water therefore it floats. Food solids sink and go to the bottom of the tank. Once a grease trap is 25% full over 60% of the fats, oils, and grease go directly down the drain and into the sanitary sewer. The percentage increases the more full of FOG the trap becomes. Grease traps should be cleaned and pumped out every 30 days.

While using soap and water to clean alloy wheels is sufficient, they will really shine when you use solutions and cleaning methods created specifically for alloy products. Use these tips to clean alloy wheels and ensure they look their best for years. Ad Steps 1 Rinse the wheels to remove dirt and brake dust. Spray them with a hose attachment that delivers a fine stream of water. 2 Rub the wheels lightly with a wet sponge. Starting the process this way will remove most of the remaining brake dust and dirt, preventing you from scratching the wheels when you scrub the surface. 3 Remove dirt and debris from alloy wheels with a store bought cleaner. Avoid acid-based cleaners because they tear the lacquer off the wheel. Mix the proper amounts of water and cleaner in a bucket. Read the instructions on the product to find out the correct ratio of water and alloy wheel cleaning solution. Soak a sponge in the bucket of cleaner and water. Squeeze the sponge over the bucket to avoid wasting the cleaner. Scrub the wheels with the sponge. Because you already rinsed and lightly rubbed off much of the dirt, hard scrubbing should not damage the alloy wheels. Use an old toothbrush to clean the crevices in the wheels. 4 Rinse off the solution. Spray the wheels with a hose to remove the cleaner solution. Do one wheel at a time to prevent solution from drying on the wheels when you clean all four at once. 5 Dry the wheels with a microfiber cloth or chamois. 6 Remove stubborn stains from alloy wheels with household items. The following solutions are mildly acidic and should not be left on the surface more than a couple of minutes before they are rinsed and dried thoroughly. Use aluminum foil and cola to remove rust. Sand the wheels with a piece of aluminum foil soaked in cola. Clean grease from alloy wheels with vinegar. Use either cider or white vinegar, as both remove grease. Apply lemon juice to the wheels to make them shine. Let the lemon juice sit on the wheels for 10 minutes, and rinse it off with water. 7 Add wheel wax to protect the alloy surface.

The car\u0027s computer takes readings of idle control adjustments and regulates the car\u0027s rpm accordingly. Therefore, if the idle air control valve is not functioning properly, you will notice that your car is revving or idling irregularly. A high, fluctuating or erratic idle, or an idle that stalls out sporadically, is a sign that you may need to clean the idle air control valve. You do not need to be a mechanic in order to clean the IACV, but you will need some familiarity with the car parts under your hood. If you drive a Honda accord and your idle control is acting up, you will find that the IACV is readily accessible for ease of maintenance. Follow these directions for how to clean a Honda idle air control valve. Ad Steps 1 Purchase a new IACV gasket. You will need to replace the old one on your Honda IACV before returning it back to its place under the hood. 2 Locate the IACV. You will find it at the back center of the under hood area, near the throttle body (TB) and mounted on the rear of the intake manifold (IM). You will have to remove the TB intake hose in order to gain access to area of the IM that is connected to the IACV. 3 Remove the Honda idle air control valve. Unscrew the 2 bolts attaching the IACV to the intake manifold. You will have to feel around for the lower bolt, which will be just out of plain sight. Pull out the gray plug from the right side of the Honda IACV. Remove the blue plug from the throttle body. Locate the coolant hose that attaches the IACV to the TB. Use needle-nose pliers to pull back the clamp that holds the coolant hose in place and then pull the hose out. This will provide enough slack to pull the Honda idle air control valve to the front so you can completely remove it. Detach the last 2 hoses from the IACV in order to free it for cleaning. 4 Remove the gasket from the Honda IACV and throw it away. 5 Examine the valve so as to identify the carbon build up that must be cleaned out. Note the areas with the heaviest concentration of filth, as you will need to pay special attention to them during the cleaning. 6 Clean the Honda idle air control valve. Spray the valve with the carb cleaner, being sure to thoroughly saturate the heavy buildup. 7 Allow the IACV to dry completely. 8 Put the new gasket in its place. 9 Reinstall the IACV going backwards through the uninstall process. 10 Adjust the idle control to its ideal setting.

They are an often overlooked safety item that is vital to navigation during heavy rain, snowfall or even a bombardment of those bugs that go splat. This article will show you very easily how to increase the life of your wipers through regular cleaning and inspection. Ad Steps 1 Take a general look at the windshield of your car. If there is no visible build-up of dirt (very dirty) then move on. If there is visible dirt, to minimize the amount of work, wash the windshield as you would the entire car.  You can go to a car wash or just simply rinse the area off with a garden hose.  The goal is to remove the worst of the stuck on debris. 2 Lay out all of the cleaning products that you intend to use in a location that is easy to reach from the windshield.  If the hood is flat enough you can place them there. 3 Lift one of the windshield wipers gently and decide what orientation is easiest to clean the blade. If you can lift the arm up all the way and it stays- great! If you can flip the wiper over so the blade is facing upward- good! If you can just get your hand under the wiper-okay! If you cannot do either than you may have to improvise or remove the wiper. 4 Place the wiper in the preferred orientation.  For this example the best on this car was to flip over the blade and allowing it to rest against the windshield.  The hand towel was used to prevent damage to the windshield. 5 Spray some cleaner liberally onto a paper towel.  You may want to double it up in order to add strength and have enough cleaner. 6 While holding the wiper, wipe from one end to the other back and forth at least a couple of times. 7 Inspect the paper towel, it should have no discoloration.  Discard the paper towel and repeat the cleaning process until this is achieved. 8 Run a fingernail along the blade carefully to check for a consistent texture.  If any blemishes are found (cuts or chunks missing) then stop and replace the wiper blade. 9 Operate the wipers while dispensing the car’s own washer fluid and confirm that the wipers leave a streak-free path in both directions. Yes: Congratulations, you are done! No: Repeat the cleaning process. No again: Clean the windshield and repeat the wiper cleaning process. No again, again. Something else beyond normal cleaning is going on here.  For example you could have a stone chip in your windshield or wiper blade failure that requires replacement.  Reader Questions and Answers Unanswered Questions Show more unanswered questions Add New Question Answered Questions Don\u0027t see your question?

It\u0027s important to know how to work with your mechanic and develop a good relationship no matter needs to be done. Know how to communicate effectively with your mechanic to avoid being taken advantage of and keep your car well-maintained. Ad Steps 1 Know your car Take the time to review the owner\u0027s manual of any car you own. Owner\u0027s manuals will have diagrams illustrating the layout of the car\u0027s parts under the hood, as well as trouble-shooting options for car trouble and safety tips. Reading your owner\u0027s manual will help you understand how your car works and make it easier for you to talk to your mechanic about repairs. 2 Use details Discuss car problems with your mechanic with lots of descriptive words that will help him understand what the car is doing. He\u0027s more likely to make an accurate diagnosis if he knows the car shakes and squeals when you turn left than if you just tell him it\u0027s making noise. The faster he can determine the problem and fix it, the less time he will spend under the hood, which will result in a lower bill for you. 3 Make him show you Communicate with your mechanic about car repairs by having him show you the problem instead of just telling you. If the car is on a lift, have the mechanic take you into the garage and point out the problem on the car. If he\u0027s not willing to do that, or if it\u0027s unsafe, ask him to draw you a diagram of the problem area so you can understand what needs to be done to fix it. 4 Get it in writing When you negotiate with a mechanic, make him print you an itemized list of costs. This list should include any charges for parts, labor, diagnostic tests and all services performed, along with the applicable taxes. This will let you know exactly what you\u0027ll be spending and will keep the mechanic from adding on any extra services that aren\u0027t necessary. 5 Ask questions Ask your mechanic as many questions as you need to understand what\u0027s wrong with your car and what services are being done to fix it. He should be willing and able to explain the work that\u0027s being done and how it will correct the problem. 6 Keep a thorough maintenance record Keep a record of all maintenance and repairs done to your car for the life of your vehicle or as long as you own it. Use this record to compare maintenance histories with your mechanic and to track services that need to be performed on a regular basis such as oil changes and tire rotations.

There are different types of trailers ranging from the enclosed trailers used to carry animals to the large V-shaped trailers that can be used to carry boats. It has to be kept in mind that the basic design of a trailer remains the same. Either you can buy a trailer for thousands of dollars or you can save that money by making your own trailer. Also, camper trailer parts \"trailerpartsdirect.com.au\"are available in plenty these days that will make your work easier. All that you have to do is to follow the simple steps that are described below. Ad Steps 1 Familiarize yourself with the traffic laws in your area. You may need special permissions or inspections in order for your trailer to be road legal. 2 Select proper axles. Car-towed trailers usually have 1 or 2 axles. Two axles can carry more weight and have better shock absorption. If you are searching for axles for custom trailers then you have choices. It would be better if you keep the following things in mind: You can find inexpensive axles at junkyards. Old truck axles or mobile home axles can be used to make a trailer. The springs and brakes should be there in the axles. Keep it in mind that you are making a trailer that is approximately 100 inches( 254cm) wide. So if you buy axles wider than that then you would need to cut them in the middle and weld them back together again to get the appropriate dimensions. 3 Buy appropriate wheels. Care needs to be taken that your wheels are specifically made for trailers. The tire measurements should be 15 inches (38 cm) wide and they must be made of bias-ply nylon. 4 Constructing the trailer frame: You should use 4 inch (10.16 cm) by 4 inch (10.16 cm) steel bars. Make a rectangular frame of the size that you want by welding the sections of the steel bar together. The frame has to be a perfect rectangle, therefore it is a must to check the corner angles as well as the diagonal measurements. Use a chop saw with a blade specifically meant to cut metals and cut 5 steel bars to the width of the frame. The axles should be 16 inches (40.6 cm) past the centre mark toward the trailer hitch end when laid underneath a reference frame. In order to provide stability, weld the width bars to the frame. You can start with the centre bar which has to be placed in the middle of the 2 axles. The next 2 bars can be welded at the either end. Weld the remaining 2 bars at the spring hanger mounting points. 5 Make a trailer tongue. Use steel bars that are 4 inch (10.16 cm) x 4 inch (10.16 cm) in size. Cut two 41 inch (104 cm) lengths of steel bar using a chop saw. The steel bars have to be positioned in such a way that half of them lie underneath the frame and half of them extend out of the frame\u0027s front. Weld them 1 on each side to the front of the frame angling them in such a manner that their ends meet and they form a triangle. Cut the tips where the steel bars meet, at the front of the trailer, using a chop saw and weld them together. 6 Connect hitch to trailer tongue. A hitch which is compatible with the vehicle that would be used for towing has to be welded to the tongue of the trailer. 7 Connect the axles to the trailer: The trailer frame is to be flipped in such a way so that its underside is up. The 2 axles on the underside of the frame are to be laid and lined up in such a manner so that they are on the either side of the centre crossbar of the frame. Now the spring hangers of the axles are to be welded to the frame. Flip the trailer over and finish welding the axles on from the top of the frame. 8 Cover the frame: Cover the frame using heavy gauge metal plates that are cut to size and them weld them in position. Alternatively you could make the deck of the frame out of wood.

Once the air temperature within the car is cooler than the outside air, then the recirculate setting is useful, because now the A/C is cooling air that has already had some of the heat sucked out of it. Invest in a reflective chrome colored sun shade and use it. This will also protect your interior from sun damage. People like the recirculate setting because it seems to move more air and thus seems more powerful. But if the car has been sitting in the sun, the air it is moving is hotter than the air outside, so it takes the A/C a lot longer to cool. Keep a rag and water in your car. Wet the rag, and wipe it over your shift knob and steering wheel to cool them. You may have to repeat the process once or twice to cool them. The water will evaporate bringing tension heat off as well. While the windows are down (Steps 1-6), adjust the airflow so the air is also blowing down into the foot wells. While parked, keep all the windows rolled down about half an inch (except during rain, snow, etc.). Warnings Obviously, if your car doesn\u0027t have A/C, you\u0027re on your own. However some of these tips can still be used to keep your car cooler overall, and allow you to drive it much quicker.

Wasn\u0027t there a deceptively deep pothole you hit the other day? Is your car now tending to pull or drift to the left or right? Or maybe there\u0027s too much \"play\" in the steering? By diagnosing any tire problems, the camber and castor of your front-end alignment, and taking it for a road test, any questions can be easily answered. And then you can move onto How to Fix the Alignment on a Car! Ad Steps 1 Eliminate tire problems. Before attempting to diagnose a front end alignment problem, you need to be sure your tires are not causing steering problems you may be experiencing. Check the air pressure on all four tires, making sure to inflate them to the recommended pressure. You should find the manufacturer\u0027s recommended inflation pressure on the label attached to the driver\u0027s side door. Check to see that the tread (or tire pattern) and tire size are the same on both front wheels. You do not want to have a mud and snow tire on one side and a normal highway tire on the other side. This, or any combination of different tire types or sizes, can cause the car to pull one way or the other. Check to see if the tires are showing unusual wear or are damaged. Look over the tire completely. Does it look symmetrical, round? Are there chunks missing from the tread? Carefully feel around the tire with your hand to see if there are deformities or bulges, indicating the tread is trying to separate from the steel belts. 2 Examine your front-end alignment. There are different aspects to front end alignments for rear wheel drive vehicles. You may observe serious alignment problems with a tape measure and a two foot level by checking them. These are: Toe-in. The front of each tire, when driving straight, points slightly to the centerline of the vehicle. This gives an advantage when cornering so each tire has equal traction (bite), but if it is angled inward (positive) too much, the OUTSIDE of the tire\u0027s tread wears more quickly. Measuring the front and rear distances between the centerline of the tires will give you an idea of how much toe-in your vehicle has. Castor. This is the vertices angle of the centerline of the tire from front to back. This angle is best checked with an automotive shop\u0027s front end equipment, but unless the ball joints, control arm bushings, or king pins are seriously worn, the castor doesn\u0027t vary too much. Camber. This is the vertical angle of the centerline of the tire perpendicular to the cross-section of your car. You can park your car on a level surface, and using a 2x4 attached to the a builder\u0027s level, check to see if they are plumb. Make sure you are measuring from the rim and not the tire itself, as it can be affected by tire bulge. 3 Road test your vehicle. Drive on a flat, level, smooth highway and do the following tests: Let your grip on the steering wheel loosen enough to let the car proceed on its own while driving down a fairly straight road on a day when the weather is dry and the wind calm. You may need an alignment if the car pulls to the left or right. Check the sounds from the front end of the car. Driving slowly, listen for scraping, whining, or grinding sounds. These may indicate excessive friction as the tire tread rubs against the road, or other problems. Have someone follow you at a moderate speed to observe the front to back wheel alignment. If the front wheels are not tracking in the same groove as the back, you may have a bent frame. This is applicable to a vehicle with a solid axel in the rear. Drive the car in a weaving pattern in an empty parking lot while someone observes the wheels. They may notice unusual leaning in the tires, or hear wheel bearings making noises, indicating problems. 4 Check for abnormal wear on the tires. You may have an alignment problem if the inside or outside of the front tires are worn. Other causes of uneven or unusual wear may include the following conditions: Worn struts or shock absorbers can cause tires to bounce while driving, creating dishing in the tread. Worn out or loose wheel bearings can cause the tire to lean, since the bearings are what keeps the wheel assembly in position on the vehicle\u0027s spindle. Worn or damaged tie-rod ends, ball joints, upper and lower control arm bushings (or kingpins, depending on the vehicle), and other steering components. A worn or damaged steering gear box or pit man arm. Poor driving habits like hard cornering, braking, or swerving can also cause tire damage or unusual wear over the life of a set of tires. 5 Have your front end checked and realigned and repeat the tests to make sure it has been done correctly.

Ask it here: Submit Video Tips A good time to check for abnormal tire wear would be when you check your tire\u0027s inflation and when you rotate your tires. Alignment problems are not uncommon and do not take a great deal of mechanical knowledge to confirm. Yet, it is important that you take your vehicle to a professional alignment shop. Professional mechanics use the right tools and equipment to put your vehicle back to the preferred alignment settings. Keep your vehicle equally loaded. Heavy loads on one side of the car puts additional strain on the suspension, and may even cause handling problems unrelated to the steering system. If the steering wheel is not straight after hitting a road hazard, there is a likely chance something got bent. A lot of modern cars (mainly with ESP) will have a steering angle sensor and will probably trigger an ABS/ ESP light to turn on when the steering wheel isn\u0027t straight. Warnings Be careful when running your hand around the edge of the tire. If the tire is trying to separate, wire from the steel belt could be poking through and rip your hand open. Maintain complete control of your vehicle while testing for the steering to pull to the left or right. If you\u0027re going to make a toe adjustment, make sure the steering wheel is centered and that the wheel is locked straight before turning any tie rods.

Ad Steps 1 Remove or tape off any windows or non-painted trimming on the vehicle. Anything that you do not want to be the same color of the car when you are done should be removed to avoid accidentally spraying them with paint. 2 Strip off the old paint in the places that need it. You can do this by using paint remover or by simply sanding all of it off the vehicle. If the paint is good, then you only need to sand it with 360 grit sandpaper. You should be down to bare metal when you are done. 3 Spray only the places that you fixed with primer. No exposed surface that you plan to paint should be left un-primed. Let the surface dry completely before you begin painting. 4 Wipe down the entire surface. You can use a painting prep solvent to remove any grease, wax or oils on it. 5 Spray the entire surface with your base coat paint. Hold the sprayer 6\" – 10\" from the surface and spray in smooth and level strokes, overlapping strokes by about 50 percent. Check the paint manufacturer\u0027s instructions about drying times before sanding. 6 Wet-sand the base coat until you get a smooth finish.

Be sure to allow the solvents in the paint to \"flash-off\" between coats to prevent drying problems. Don\u0027t just dip the sandpaper in water. Let it soak for a minute or two so it\u0027s nice and wet. After your first coat of base paint dries, apply another one. Try spraying several very thin coats of base paint to avoid runs or drips in your paint\u0027s surface. Try this with the clear coat paint as well. If you make any mistakes (such as beading of paint), you can always sand it down and start over at the top. \"Flash-off\" is the evaporating of the solvents in the paint. 5-10 minutes between coats is recommended based on temperature. A hazy finish means the paint has flashed-off. Use a rubber block when sanding. This will prevent you from applying uneven pressure to the sandpaper and sanding through. Rubber sanding blocks can be bought from a hardware store or vehicle paint shop. Warnings Do not sand with dry sandpaper or a sandpaper with a low grit rating. Wet sanding should be done using 2,000 grit (or higher) sandpaper. This will prevent swirling the finish of the base coat and get rid of any \u0027orange-peel\u0027, \u0027FLA (Fat Lady\u0027s [Rump])\u0027 or bumps in the paint.

You can actually do much of this yourself, even if you are not a good mechanic or only have limited knowledge on the technical aspect of an automobile. However, with a little extra reading on basic inspection and maintenance, you can learn enough to perform some basic care maintenance tasks and save a lot money in the process. Once you have a general understanding of how to maintain and inspect your car, you won’t need to take the vehicle to a professional mechanic in case of minor problems. Conducting inspection maintenance for your car is not that difficult at all. It only involves the following steps. Ad Steps 1 Conduct a regular tire inspection. This is the easiest component of maintenance inspection, yet the most neglected one. Try to do this before or after driving a car. When you inspect the tire see to it that all of them are not flat or under pressure. The tire inspection would also allow you to determine if one of these have damages or in great need for replacement. 2 Inspect the tire regularly to determine if there are possible damages on the car’s suspension. A good indicator of a damaged suspension is the position of the tires. In case each tire tilts towards or out of the vehicle, this could mean that the suspensions are not in good shape. The best that you could do is to take the vehicle to a professional mechanic and have it repaired. 3 Check the tire pressure. This will help you determine if a tire needs to be inflated. In this particular task, you will need a tire pressure gauge and a piece of coin. Use the tire pressure gauge to check if each of the tires is not over or under-inflated. This could ensure that your car would be running smoothly on the road. The coin on the other hand is used to measure the depth of the tire’s tread. When you are using a penny with Lincoln’s head engraved in it, try to insert the coin into the tread’s center in a manner that the head points down. In case you can see the entire head from the side, this could mean that you need to replace tires as soon as possible. Try to do this at least once a week. 4 Check the oil level of the car\u0027s engine. This is necessary since oil deficiency inside the engine might damage the car\u0027s drive train. To prevent this from happening, inspect the oil level every week. Just open the hood of the car, search the location of the the dipstick and check the oil volume inside the engine. You can easily spot this area since it is usually labeled as “OIL” or “ENGINE OIL”. Try to use the dipstick to check the oil level. Once it is below the recommended level, try to add some oil. However, if it is still on the recommended range, just check on it regularly for the level would eventually decrease as the days go by.

It\u0027s important to do this if you will be storing the tank for over two months without anticipated use. If you do not do this, then it is necessary to use a gas stabilizer. Generators are generally an expensive home product so you need to take excellent care of it in order to keep it from failing during use. Ad Steps 1 Open the gas tank cap to create air flow through tank. 2 Locate the fuel valve switch. Turn it to the position in which it can be pushed back through the plastic cover over the fuel lines. (See the video below for a full example.) 3 Remove the plastic cover that is over the fuel lines. This needs to be done in order to make it easier to access the fuel lines. This should be fairly easy to do; there are generally a couple of large bolts holding the cover in place. (See the video below for example of a cover that is on the 6800 Watt Ridgid Generator.) You will need a wrench or socket wrenches to remove the cover. 4 Push the fuel valve through the cover. Move the cover out of the way. Make sure that the fuel valve is set to off. This is so that the fuel valve is closed when you remove one side of the line in the next step. 5 Pinch and remove the aluminum clip off the side of the fuel line that does not connect to the gas tank. Have a rag close by to catch a little gas that is left in the tube you are removing (the tube that runs to the carburetor). Then remove the tube from the fuel valve. You may need to use pliers the first time because it\u0027s sealed fairly tightly. Do not disconnect the line that runs to the gas tank, or gas will pour everywhere. 6 Put the fuel valve tube into a collection container large enough to hold all the gas in the tank. This will generally be about 5–10 gallons (18.9–37.9 L). You can use a gas can so that you can put the gas into your car so it doesn\u0027t go to waste (see the video for an example). 7 Turn the fuel valve to on. Let all of the gas drain out into the container until no more comes out. Once you\u0027re done, reconnect the fuel line and replace the cover. 8 Locate the carburetor. There will be a screw on the base of the carburetor that is used to open the drain. Sometimes it is labeled on the generator. See your generator\u0027s instruction manual to help you locate it. 9 Place a small collection container under the carburetor. Turn the screw to the left to open the drain hole. Only a small amount will come out. 10 Once the gas has stopped coming out, turn the screw to the right to close again. (See the video below for more information; watch the steps carefully.)

It becomes more difficult when you are not sure if your service provider is giving you quality service or not. Sometimes ignorance can cost us heavily when the mechanics indulge in inferior service. To find out which car serve provider provides best service in town, ensure these things: Ad Steps 1 Determine if the car service provider follows laws meant for customer satisfaction. When you bring your car to the car service provider, please check ahead if they follow all the rules required to be followed by them as guided by the law of the country. You can know this while signing a contract with a garage, by reading the terms and conditions properly. As these rules are meant for consumers for ensuring their rights. Under these rights: You are ensured that work carried out in the garage is done with care and skill. If a part is replaced, the other part should be of satisfactory quality. If garage does not fix the parts properly, you have the right to take your car to another service provider and recover the cost from the garage. If garage uses faulty parts in your car, you are entitled to refund or ask for replacement. 2 Determine if it has a Membership code of conduct: See, if the service provider is a member of a code of conduct. This may not inevitably result in better service, but it guarantees a sure measure of credibility to the service provider. The aim of the code is to set out the measure and practices of any car service garage, so that you can arrive at an informed and favorable conclusion as to the suitability of the services on offer. 3 Ask for opinions from others: Before breaking for any auto service provider, confirm from others who have visited it earlier. Many sites provide independent online reviews of where you can check which car service garage is better and offer better service. But you should check according to the needs of your car. 4 Compare prices of different service providers: If you don\u0027t want your car to stop working because of the bad service, compare handbook of four to five service providers to ascertain the type of service you require – car service after 5000 miles or 6 months. Get quotes: Generate a written quotation for the same service from several garages – this will help you find the best price. Make sure in advance that the owner is not giving you an estimate and telling you the actual cost. Determine whether the quotation includes all constituents, labor and VAT. Note down who you spoke to related to price. Inquire whether the garage will work in conjunction with the manufacturer\u0027s guidelines and will use original parts or those of ‘equivalent quality\u0027. Don\u0027t forget to ask how long the work will take. This way you\u0027ll be able to negotiate on prices before agreeing for getting your car serviced. 5 See if there is a Provision for Membership packages: It is very common these days, some car service providers offer membership package. Under this, your service provider takes care of your car for any problem for next one year. One year membership varies from $1000 to $1200, but there are a few old car service providers which give you this service under $1000. Check for such service provider around the globe. Maybe you find it nearby your hometown or suburb. 6 Be sure the provider is established. Is your service provider well established: There are many new and just born car service providers who in order to settle their business make false promises to you but sometimes fail to do so. It is not the case with all the new service providers but you should be cautious against such car service providers.

While exploratory wells are successful about 60% of the time,[1] those numbers are closer to 10% for wildcat wells (drilled in areas greater than 1.5 miles from the nearest producing well).[2] Because the cost of drilling is rising quickly,[3] you will want to do everything you can to be sure your exploratory well finds oil. Ad Steps Part 1 Knowing Where to Look 1 Know that oil is found in sedimentary rock formations. Oil is formed from microscopic ocean organisms that sank to the bottom of the ocean millions of years ago, forming layers of organic material and mud.[4] Time and pressure transform the mud into shale, the organic material into oil, and surrounding sand and calcium deposits into sandstone and limestone.[5] Because the oil is less dense than rock, it migrates laterally and vertically through fissures in the rock and through tiny pours in the surrounding sandstone until it is blocked by a barrier of impermeable rock, called a trap (usually composed of shale or a salt dome). This trapped oil is called a reservoir. 2 Use regional geology as a guide to where oil might be found. Look for areas with thick layers of sedimentary rocks and for features that might indicate an oil trap. Domed formations of rock often indicate salt domes – formed when areas of the ocean repeatedly dried out, leaving layers of salt, which were later buried by sediments. Creases in the rock or faults can cut off permeable layers with impermeable rock.[6] Imagine layer upon layer of rock, with a permeable layer sandwiched between two impermeable ones. Oil would typically escape the permeable layer by moving to the sides, but if a fault or fold of rock moves one of the impermeable layers up or down, it can block the lateral flow of oil, as shown here. 3 Know where oil reserves are most frequently discovered. Because oil results from the rapid burial of microorganisms in a low oxygen environment, it is often found in the off shore coastal margins of ocean basins (like the Gulf of Mexico or Caspian Sea), which provide these conditions. The movement of tectonic plates (gigantic sections of the earth\u0027s crust)[7] has also left many oil deposits in arctic or desert environments.[8] 4 Consider drilling in or near areas with proven reserves. The further you move away from proven oil fields, the less likely you are to find oil. Historically, wildcat wells (drilled in areas greater than 1.5 miles from the nearest producing well) only find enough oil to pay for drilling 6-12% of the time. Only 2-3% yield enough oil to justify an adjacent well, and only 1 out of 700 discover enough oil to develop a field.[9] 5 Look for seeps or leaks. If no trap is present, oil will flow to the surface. The resulting surface oil is called a seep, and seeps are a good indicator that there may be oilfields nearby in areas where impermeable rock does form a trap. Many traps, particularly in the ocean, also have small fissures that allow for oil to slowly leak out. The detection of trace amounts of hydrocarbons in the water might indicate a reservoir.[10] Part 2 Mapping Potential Reservoirs 1 Map and study the structures you are considering. In 2007, the cost of drilling an exploratory well averaged $4 million,[11] and offshore wells cost much more: $20 to $100 million.[12] Before you drill, you’ll want to do everything you can to make sure the reservoir is large, porous enough to hold lots of oil, and permeable enough to produce at high rates.[13] Porosity – Even though sandstone appears solid, it is in fact porous, much like a sponge. Porosity is a measure of a rock’s ability to hold fluid. It is normally expressed as a percentage of the total rock which is taken up by pore space. For example, sandstone with 8% porosity will by 92% solid rock and 8% open space containing oil, gas or water. 8% is the minimum porosity required for a decent oil well.[14] Permeability – Permeability is a measure of how easily fluid flows through a rock. If it takes a lot of pressure to squeeze fluid through, then the rock has low permeability (low perm). Shale, for instance, while highly porous, has very low permeability, making it difficult to pump oil from shale. If fluid passes through easily, then it has high permeability (high perm). Sandstone is typically highly permeable. Permeability is usually expressed in units call millidarcies. Productive oil reservoirs come from rocks that have ten to several hundred millidarcys.[15] 2 Conduct a magnetic survey. Oil is found in sedimentary rocks, which are non-magnetic, as opposed to magnetic igneous rocks, which are formed from cooling lava or magma.[16] An airborne magnetometer can measure the magnitude of the earth’s magnetic field over a large area, helping to determine if enough sedimentary rocks are likely to be present. A field balance can then be used on the earth’s surface to measure magnetism in specific locations, helping to map the location of sedimentary and igneous rock formations.[17] 3 Use seismic data to map the density, thickness, and position of the rock. Seismic data is collected by sending sound waves into the earth’s crust. There are two types of seismic data which, when combined and analyzed with computers, can help locate low density rock layers (sandstone or limestone) topped with higher density rock (shale), as well as folds, faults, or domes that might create traps.[18] Refraction sends sound waves down to a bed of rock, which they travel along before bouncing back up to sensors. Because sound moves faster through denser rock, refraction can be used to map out rock densities.[19] Reflection is based on the echo of sound waves off layers of varying density rock, which reflect the waves back to the surface, allowing engineers to determine the position and thickness of layers.[20] By using multiple geophones or hydrophones (sensitive microphones on land and water, respectively), scientists can create three-dimensional images of the earth’s sediment layers.[21] 4 Evaluate core samples at promising sites. A core is a narrow column of rock that is taken from the top to bottom of a well. It shows the rock in sequential order as it appears in the ground. Core samples provide more detailed information on porosity, permeability, and saturation of the rock, as well as indicating how thick the various layers are.[22] 5 Use the data you have collected to create a 3D visualization of the potential reservoir. Running the seismic and magnetic survey data through computer programs can create a three dimensional picture of the strata that will let you know if the potential reservoir is large enough to be profitable.[23] Part 3 Drilling an Exploratory Well 1 Have your landman or negotiator obtain a production sharing contract (PSA) through the government (for non-US oil rights) or a lease with the private landowner or Federal or State offshore block (for US oil rights). You don\u0027t want to spend a lot of money drilling an expensive exploration well if you don\u0027t own clear sub-surface rights. Under a PSA, a state engages a foreign oil company (FOC) as a contractor to provide technical and financial services for exploration and development operations. The FOC is given a share of the oil produced as a reward for the risk taken and services rendered. The state remains the owner of the petroleum produced.[24] Leases in offshore blocks or federal lands are arranged through federal or state government-organized sales.[25] 2 Drill an exploratory well. In 2010, 61% of exploratory wells were successful,[26] but the rate for wildcat wells is much lower (6-12%).[27] 3 Analyze rock samples as you drill. Checking the porosity, permeability, and saturation of the rock can help you know if it is worth it to keep drilling your exploratory well.[28] 4 Test the well’s productivity. You will want to determine flow rate in terms of standard barrels per day and the reservoir size in order to estimate the lifetime well productivity.[29] 5 Decide whether it will be profitable to set up a producing well. Plugging and abandoning an exploratory well costs only a few thousand dollars, whereas completing the well for production can cost from $50,000 to millions of dollars, depending on the depth of the well and whether it is on land or at sea.[30][31] To make sure it is worth it to proceed, estimated lifetime productivity must be weighed against the costs of completing the well, operating expenses, the market for oil, and the local tax/royalty regime.

Instead, protect your investment, and get from Point A to Point B as reliably as possible. Keeping your car running longer might be as easy as checking the fluid levels and making sure the tires and well inflated. Ad Steps 1 Read the car\u0027s manual and schedule maintenance accordingly. Keeping up with your car\u0027s recommended maintenance schedule can help avoid costly problems with your cooling system, drive train, suspension and other components; following the recommended schedule also helps ensure you the get the full benefit of the manufacturer\u0027s warranty. 2 Drive less. Especially, avoid short trips. Cold starts are hard on engines, your gas mileage, and the environment. Short trips can also significantly shorten the life of your muffler. Basically, you get condensation in the exhaust when you start a cold engine, and if you don\u0027t run the car for long enough to evaporate all of the condensation out of the system, excessive amounts of water can accumulate in your muffler, and rust a hole through it. Avoid starting a cold car just to pull it into the garage, for instance. Consider walking to the nearest store for a change. Combine short errands, and, if you have multiple vehicles, drive the one more recently driven when you go out again. Do drive a car at least every week or so, since cars that sit for longer than a week or two at a time have other problems, such as fluids gradually draining out of systems. Consult a mechanic if you will store a car for an extended period. 3 Check the fluids: You should check the level of your antifreeze, oil, transmission fluid, power steering fluid, and brake fluid, very regularly: like every time you buy gas. Even if your car doesn\u0027t leak fluids, it can develop a leak and quickly have a dangerously low level of something. You should also check the color of some of these fluids. Some of these have see-through plastic tanks that you can look through, and some have dipsticks. Antifreeze should be either pink, green, or yellow (Pink for newer cars with \"Dex-Cool\", green for old cars with plain Ethyl-Glycol, and green or yellow for cars that have been flushed and filled with universal antifreeze...brown antifreeze should always be flushed, it either has rust or a lot of dirt in it, probably both. Also, never mix different kinds of antifreeze; if you don\u0027t know what color antifreeze your car has, buy a universal brand. Oil should be relatively clear, not black - black oil has been left in the engine for too long. Oil that looks white and milkshake-like has water in it, probably from an internal antifreeze leak, or very rarely, just a large amount of condensation. Transmission fluid should be bright red, and should not smell burnt...it probably needs to be changed if it\u0027s brown or smells burnt. 4 Change the oil regularly: This will improve your gas mileage and protect your engine. The recommended mileage between oil changes is 3,000 - 5,000 miles (or 5000 - 8000 kilometres) or every 3 to 6 months. Doing this could make it possible for your vehicle to attain 200,000 miles (or about 320,000 kilometres). Change the oil filter as well - there is no sense in putting clean oil through a dirty filter, and filters are very cheap and available at any parts store. Please check your service manual, or contact your dealer for your car\u0027s specific needs. 5 Change the air filter: This is something you can do easily at home without using tools, and should be done approximately every 12 thousand miles. You can buy a matching filter at nearly any auto parts store and your owner\u0027s manual will show you where your air filter is located. A dirty, dusty filter can lower gas mileage. 6 Flush these fluids every two years: power steering fluid, brake fluid, and cooling system anti-freeze. Check this timetable against your owner\u0027s manual. Newer cars generally allow longer intervals between changes. Change transmission fluid \u0026 filter at least every 50,000 miles (40k to 45k is even better). 7 Monitor your brake pad thickness and don\u0027t let the pads wear down to metal - this will cause damage to your brake rotors (\"discs\") at least and possibly your calipers as well. Rotors and calipers are much more expensive to replace than pads. There is no such thing as \"cleaning\" a brake pad while it is still on a car - the friction between the pad and rotor will eradicate any outside substance almost immediately. 8 Rotate the tires. Changing tire position is very important and reduces uneven wear and tear on the tread, thus extending the life of the tires. The recommended rotation cycle is twice a year or every 6,000 miles. Rotate them diagonally - front right to rear left and front left to rear right. However, this pattern can change depending on the drivetrain of the vehicle, and the type of tire. Your vehicle manual will contain detailed rotation information. Keep in mind some tires (especially on sports cars) are directional and are meant to spin only one way. They will have a large arrow on the sidewall to indicate this. 9 Keep the tires inflated. Under-inflated tires can reduce the tire life by 15% and will slightly decrease your gas mileage, perhaps by 10%. Inflating tires is perhaps the easiest of all activities, and many stores sell tire gauges for a very small cost. Checking your tire pressure every other time you get gas will reduce tire wear and prevent these issues. Monitor your tire tread with a penny. Insert the penny into the tread with Lincoln\u0027s head down. If the top of his head is not obscured by the tread, your tires need to be replaced. Basically, if you can see all of Lincoln\u0027s head, you must replace your tires. 10 Keep the front end aligned. If you notice your car shaking while driving at high speeds (not while braking - shuddering while braking indicates warped rotors), or if your tread is wearing unevenly, then you may need an alignment. This is also key to extending the life of your tires and will keep the tread even for increased safety. 11 Get your car off to a good start every time you drive it. Start the car and drive off slowly and gently until the car reaches operating temperature. This reduces the strain on the engine while the oil is still cold and thicker. Another option is to use electric engine space heaters, and start the drive with a warm engine. Accelerate promptly to the target speed. For most modern cars, idling a cold engine is both counterproductive and wasteful. Additionally, as you accelerate, release the gas a bit to cause the automatic transmission to upshift while you are not pressing hard on the gas. This causes less wear on the internal clutches. It is easier on the clutches for the car to shift when you ease up on the gas. 12 Use your parking brake. Even if you are driving a car with an automatic transmission, use your parking brake regularly, especially if you\u0027re parked on an incline. It helps keep the brakes adjusted in the rear of the car and makes them last longer. Do not use your parking brake in the wintertime because your brake will freeze and it will be stuck until it thaws out. 13 Wash your car: Road salt, sludge and pollution can lead to costly body work. Without regular cleaning, you can start to notice rust on the bottom of your doors within four years. Another three to four years and the corrosion will creep to underbody components, like brake lines. It can cost thousands in rust-related repairs if you neglect to wash your car, especially near ocean/gulf shorelines where the road sand or morning dew might be salty.

Ask it here: Submit Tips Manual transmission cars or cars with turbo/superchargers will require different maintenance schedules, depending on the climate, road conditions. Always consult your owner\u0027s manual or ask a local dealership service department. Regular oil changes are a very cheap insurance and you get better mileage anyway. Always warm up at least 30 seconds. IF you are headed straight onto a freeway on ramp, let the engine warm up before you take off, otherwise you do a lot of high speed driving cold, not good for the engine If your user manual says it\u0027s best to let the car warm up a little first before forcing it to apply power to the wheels, it\u0027s best to follow it and do so; for as written several times before, the people who made it know best. The best thing that you can do to extend the life of your car and potentially save yourself a bundle of money is to have your car serviced on a routine basis. All car manufacturers have a schedule of recommended service for each vehicle they sell. Follow this schedule. The best place to have work done on a new vehicle that is still under warranty is the dealership. On cars without a warranty, it is best to find a reputable independent shop and have it serviced regularly there. Synthetic oils may be initially more expensive, but can provide longer protection than conventional motor oil. Oils have a grade SM is the newest and provides most protection. Oils have a viscosity Cold and Hot, make sure you have the right grade for summer and winter especially if you live where it snows. The most important thing is to use a quality branded oil. Good oils are honey coloured when new. Change the oil at least as frequently as the manufacturer recommends. If you wish to have longer oil change intervals, you must send our samples for lab testing to make sure that your oil is still providing adequate protection. If your oil fails, you will have expensive engine repairs. Understand that some folks cling to 3,000 mile oil changes, but in modern cars that is too frequent and is wasteful. Check your local auto parts dealer for manuals specific to your car for complete instructions on how to perform basic maintenance on your vehicle. Often, you will save a bundle of cash doing simple tune-up work on your own. Schuck\u0027s and Autozone are great stores that have these manuals. Warnings Avoid Fuel-additives: Only injector cleaner additives are of value, don\u0027t bother with octane boosters just buy premium fuel. Avoid engine oil FLUSH if your motor is sludged up because of missed oil changes these flushes can make a large chunk of sludge come off and block an oil channel. Only use if your mechanic says you must. Beware First-time Repairs: Do not attempt to complete repairs on your vehicle without supervision if you have never attempted a repair before. Today\u0027s cars are complex jigsaw-puzzles and might require removing several components to reach one particular screw. Get help at first. Check Warranty: Check the terms and conditions before repairing your vehicle on your own while if it is still under warranty. Unless you are a certified mechanic, this may invalidate your warranty. Avoid pot-holes: which can knock air out of tires or dislodge weights to throw tires out of balance.

It also teaches the rules of positioning, so when it comes to staying safe, consider the steps needed to Feng Shui your car. The positive energy produced using this method will lead to success, according to Feng Shui principles. Ad Steps 1 Turn your music on once you get into your car if you want to Feng Shui your vehicle. This will rid of negative chi that may be remaining in the space. Removing the negative energy will allow you to drive in a revitalized space. 2 Remove all the clutter and trash from your car and allow the positive chi to flow through. Clean it out and vacuum the carpets and seats. Anything that is not needed in the car should be cleared out. Feng Shui principle teaches that clutter creates chaos and trapped energy, and it can weaken the driver\u0027s energy. 3 Connect with one of the elements by keeping a bottle of water in your car and drinking water regularly. Water represents clarity and thoughtfulness and therefore can assist in improving the awareness of the mind. Water also flushes out the negative energies that fill the space, caused by electronic devices such as cell phones. 4 Always keep your windows clean and clear. According to Feng Shui principles, windows are considered the eyes of your vehicle, so always keep them clean to allow easy access for positive energy to flow in. 5 Add Feng Shui to your car by sprinkling sea salt on the floor to absorb any negative energy that your passengers may bring into it. Vacuuming the salt out of the car on a regular basis in fine since it removes the negative energy along with it. Then you can sprinkle fresh salt. 6 Include symbols of protection in your vehicle\u0027s d?cor. Dragons and rhinoceros are 2 popular examples of protective symbols. Dragons are also very lucky. Rhinos represent protection against accidents and thieves. Adding dragons and rhinos to your keychain or hanging them from your rearview mirror are visual reminders of the energies protecting you and your car. 7 Remain grounded with the element earth as you travel. This can be done by keeping stones or dirt in a small box inside your glove box. There is no limit to how much Feng Shui can be added to cars. 8 Understand how color makes a difference according to Feng Shui teaching. For this reason, you should learn what colors mean and, if possible, choose colors for your car and interior that reflect the feelings your wish to instill.

With just a few tips, you\u0027ll be driving comfortably for years to come. Ad Steps 1 First, try to research various automotive certifications. A good auto mechanic will be ASE (Automotive Service Excellence) Certified and should have a certification indicating what areas he is proficient in. 2 Another thing to look for is affiliation signs. AAA will certify some local repair shops after examining their credentials and business policies, and they will have a list of those shops on their website. 3 Ask around. Your friends, family, and colleagues have cars, and have to get them serviced somewhere. Find out how they feel about their mechanics. 4 Check online reviews. Look for reviewers\u0027 overall impression, without too much weight to isolated very bad or very good reviews: a reviewer here and there may be unreasonable, mistaken, dishonest, or simply grumpy. 5 Investigate procedures online. Internet sites and discussions can provide \"sanity checks\" on prices and reasons for repairs. Bear in mind that prices can vary significantly from place to place and a lot from car to car, and that sometimes things do go bad unexpectedly. 6 \"Stake-out\" your local shops. This means driving past and checking out the facilities. Look for clean, orderly grounds and work areas and people engaged purposefully in their work. Grounds chock-full of cars being actively worked through aren\u0027t a bad thing, though perhaps not for you if you have a very valuable car or show-quality finish to protect from even the slightest tap. Take notice of the makes, quantity, and quality of the other customers\u0027 cars. If you drive a 5 year old Ford truck, and the only vehicles you see around are run-down, old Fiats in the parking lot that probably isn\u0027t the place for you. Professional drivers are likely to be well-informed, so taxis, limos, or work vans around can indicate a good economical shop. 7 Balance price and convenience. Any mechanic should work honestly, effectively, and avoid big surprises on cost or time. Going to a more-expensive shop alone doesn\u0027t guarantee anything, but recognize that it legitimately costs more to provide: Convenient location. It costs more to rent, or forego income by not renting out, space in a fancy or densely-populated area. But, if you live or work in such an area, taking your car here may help you get back to your other activities more quickly. Some shops, typically fancy ones like dealerships, provide free shuttles. There are many non-expensive areas within short distances from train or bus stops--consider your safety to, from and at those, though. A cab ride to and from a shop in an inconvenient area may be well worth the money you can save on a repair. Occasionally one of the workers may offer you a lift. Call to ask about transit options before going. New and spacious waiting, office and repair areas. Buildings, like cars, cost money to build and keep shiny. Accumulation of dirt and serious decay can suggest an attitude problem, though. More time to talk and mitigate unexpected delays. It can sometimes take a lot of time to explain some problems with a level of detail suitable for those not familiar with cars or to deal with unexpected problems that may appear. A shop that does less business overall may have more time to explain things and may introduce less delay for unusual problems because it already has slack in its schedule. If you expect to have something complicated to ask about at a busy shop, be prepared to wait awhile; better yet, ask what times are less busy before going. More parts on hand. Larger shops, and those that specialize in particular kinds of work or cars, can often save time with parts taken from a comprehensive inventory rather than waiting for them to arrive from elsewhere, though even that can be pretty fast near a city. All original-equipment-manufacturer (\"OEM\") or other new parts. Car manufacturers make, or obtain through their parts suppliers, and sell spare parts that should match the originals perfectly, known as OEM parts. Dealers normally use these. Other, \"aftermarket\" manufacturers, make new replacement parts. \"Re-builders\" or \"re-manufacturers\" take apart and clean complex used parts such as engines and transmissions, replace whatever may have broken, readjust, refit or replace whatever tends to wear out, and reassemble, lubricate, and seal them. Aftermarket and rebuilt parts typically cost much less and are often just as good. There are established aftermarket and rebuilding companies with their own reputations to protect. Junkyards, often called \"salvage\" or \"used auto parts\" companies, are particularly good for saving money on things that don\u0027t wear out, like doors and mirrors, but the particular part to be used has to be examined and the appearance normally won\u0027t be perfect. Independent mechanics typically use aftermarket parts, and sometimes rebuilt or salvage parts, but should ask before installing something that is not new. An insurer may sometimes waive \"betterment\" charges for replacing old parts that got broken if you agree to have aftermarket parts used. Ask about this if an insurer is paying for your repairs. Specialization. Many mechanics can do good work on all kinds of common cars. But many parts on antiques work in odd, obsolete ways, and many parts on top-of-the-line luxury cars or exotic cars can work in odd ways to squeeze out a little extra performance. And replacements can be hard to find. So if you have one of these, look for a mechanic who works with similar cars as a substantial part of his business. If the car has collector value, make sure any replacement parts are sufficiently \"authentic\". Dealerships generally charge quite a bit more for parts and labor than other mechanics, but they\u0027re supposed to know your vehicle and be able to get the job done perfectly. 8 Talk to the mechanic, ask questions and request to see the old parts when they are removed. When a mechanic puts a face to the vehicle and knows he may be talking with you again he is more likely to be more particular about how he performs the repairs.

Ask it here: Submit Tips After you find what you believe to be a quality mechanic, but before you dedicate your car to that person, test out the relationship you will have with him. Take your car in for just an oil change to see how he is going to treat you. You can also follow these steps to find a body shop, upholsterer, or other automotive specialist. Take more care in choosing these. Many are just fine, or even very resourceful in helping you get an old car back in service for cheap. But their lines of business may be more suited to unscrupulous operators because much of their work derives from accidents, limiting customers\u0027 time to shop around, to check their practices with small jobs first, or to gather a basis for comparison to other shops or similar procedures. Your mechanic or a friend in a vehicle-related profession may be able to recommend one. If a third party such as a warranty provider or insurer is to pay for the repairs, check that they will accept the mechanic. (With a manufacturer\u0027s warranty, the dealer is typically to provide the repairs.) Warnings Be wary of a repair station that always wants to do more than you asked for. It\u0027s nice of them to check your vehicle over for potential problems, but if every time you go they find something major wrong they\u0027re probably trying to rip you off. There\u0027s even a word for this unscrupulous practice: \"up-selling\" a job. Get a second opinion from someone several shops away. If the supposed problem requires significant effort to inspect, it would be reasonable to pay a fee for that.

This is a good way to save money but part of having a car, especially one that is older, means getting repairs and maintenance done on it. Some people go to their local dealers and are able to get oil changes done for a fairly cheap price. But when a customer goes to a dealer, the mechanics will often times try to get you to have more work done on the car than what is needed. This will drive the cost of the repairs up to almost double compared to smaller auto shops. It can be cheaper going to a car repair shop, but you have to make sure that the mechanic is experienced and certified. Here are a few things to look for: Ad Steps 1 The car repair shop is certified and belongs to an organization or two for highly qualified mechanics. This is something that you owe it to yourself to check out. If you ask the mechanics or the managers about their credentials, they should be glad to show you proof of that. If they aren\u0027t, or if they seem to get angry and defensive, that is your queue to leave, and immediately! Your vehicle investment is too valuable to you in so many ways to trust to anyone with a wrench and a garage! 2 Does the car repair shop have good references? What are your friends, family members, and associates saying about this car repair shop? You know full well that these are the people who are going to tell you the truth, especially if they\u0027ve had a bad experience with the shop. So do your homework certainly in this area, and ask around. 3 Check out their shop for organization and cleanliness. While some people might not feel that this issue is a big deal, it actually is on a lot of levels. The bottom line is that a clean and organized shop shows respect for the comfort, and the welfare of the customers. No customer wants to wait for their car in a shop that is dingy, cold, and grimy. They don\u0027t want to sit on chairs that are dirty, and full of muck that looks as if it\u0027s been stuck on the chairs for the past 30 years. The carpeting if any should be fresh looking and smelling. Any hard floors should be swept and cleaned. It goes without saying that the restrooms should be sanitary and fresh. After all, if the car repair shop doesn\u0027t care about the comfort of the customers in the lobby, do you really think that they are going to care about the vehicle safety that the customers are coming to them for? 4 Make sure the mechanics there are experienced and have good work ethic. This ties in with the last point. Your mechanics should be transparent. They should charge you a fair price for the work done. You should understand clearly what work has been done. There should be no hidden charges, fees, or surprises. If you go to get a repair done for a particular area, and the other components worked before you brought the car in, those working components should still be working when the car leaves the shop. An estimate that starts at a couple of hundred dollars shouldn\u0027t end up cost a couple of thousand dollars. The mechanics should get your authorization for any and all work done. They shouldn\u0027t proceed on any repairs that you haven\u0027t authorized. 5 Check with several shops for prices to see if there is one that is over charging. Find a trustworthy mechanic that will give you what you are looking for and not trying to rob you by overcharging for other things you do not even need. 6 See the last point for more on this. If a car repair shop is in fact overcharging you, then call them on it, or at least get them to match the prices of another shop. They will come down on the price if they really desire and value your business.

Know how to find parks for a vintage Mercedes-Benz so you can keep your classic car running smoothly. Ad Steps 1 Make sure that your car is really vintage before starting to look for parts. Most cars are not considered to be \"vintage\" until they are at least 30 years of age. Examining the registration of your car can tell you if your car is indeed vintage. This step is very important as parts for cars which are not vintage can often be found in the parts department of Mercedes-Benz dealerships, through online retailers, or even in junkyards. In contrast, finding parts for vintage Mercedes-Benz cars can be more difficult. 2 Talk to your mechanic. Working with your mechanic is especially important if he or she specializes in the repair of Mercedes-Benz cars. If this is the case, the mechanic will likely have a number of leads on where you can find specific parts for your car. 3 Contact Mercedes-Benz restorers. As with mechanics, Mercedes-Benz restorers are often on the lookout for spare parts. In some cases, a restorer may be a better source than a mechanic, as a restorer will usually be looking specifically for vintage parts. Discuss with these individuals the type of Mercedes-Benz that you own, and the parts which are needed. They may be able to point you in the right direction. 4 Visit online discussion boards. The Mercedes-Benz Club of America has a website that is a worthwhile starting point for car owners when looking for a wealth of individuals who are knowledgeable about this specific make of car.

This is done with the engine in the car and the head torqued down. Ad Steps 1 Make an indicator from some clear plastic tubing, a jar of light oil, and an old spark plug. 2 Break up an old spark plug and attach a length of clear plastic tubing to it (make it airtight). 3 Remove all the spark plugs. 4 Stick your thumb OVER the #1 cylinder spark plug hole. Rotate the engine (see note below on tricks for this) until you feel pressure on your thumb. That\u0027s the compression stroke. TDC is at the top of this stroke. 5 Screw in the spark plug with plastic tubing attached and insert the other end of the tube into a jar of light oil. Continue rotating the engine. Bubbles will appear until the piston reaches the top of its travel. When it starts down on the next stroke, the bubbles will stop and oil will begin traveling up the tube. Stop at a convenient point and mark the tube. Then mark the crank pulley and the engine body at a convenient spot. 6 Rotate the engine backwards and watch the oil recede into the jar. Continue rotating. As the piston continues past TDC and downward it will again suck oil into the tube. Rotate the engine till the oil again reaches the mark. STOP! Mark the crankshaft pulley where it lines up with the mark you made previously on the engine. You should now have two marks on the crankshaft pulley. The midpoint of these two marks lined up with the mark on the engine is tdc. Whoa! Almost like finding South with a wristwatch. Boy and girl scouts listen up. 7 Open the bonnet and support it. Find a socket spanner and togglebar to fit the crankshaft pulley nut. Remove all of the spark plugs noting which plug lead fits which plug, number them with adhesive tape. With a small/medium screwdriver insert it gently into No1 cylinder and support the screwdriver whilst rotating the crankshaft pulley slowly until you feel the piston rising and touching the screwdriver. Continue turning slowly until the piston begins to go down. you will have hit top dead centre and started on down. Look down at the rim of the crankshaft pulley you should find an engineered mark on it (a torch may be useful here) which should be adjacent to another mark on the timing case housing or the engine block, when these marks are aligned you have top dead centre.

There are a number of ways. Maybe you can reach the crankshaft pulley bolt with a wrench. Again with a manual transmission, the engine can be rotated by placing it in a high gear, removing the right rear wheel and levering it using the wheel bolts and a long iron pipe. Tighten up the alternator and try a wrench on that. You can also use a soda straw sticking out of the spark plug hole. Trouble is that there are several degrees of crankshaft rotation where the piston remains stationary. If the oil jar is attached to the car somehow and if it\u0027s a manual transmission you can put the transmission in 3rd or 4th gear and roll the car back and forth.

Window tint shades can vary from a nearly undetectable pale blue to a nearly opaque black-out, and may be solid or graduated from top to bottom. Additionally, window tints can be applied by professionals in a shop or by you, the car owner, using a store-bought window tinting kit. On occasion, a window tint job may start peeling and/or bubbling, prompting a need for you to fix tinted windows. If that applies to you, follow these directions for how to fix a bad window-tinting job on your car. Ad Steps 1 Seek the help of a professional. This is the ideal route to take if you paid a professional to apply window tinting and the tint job is still under warranty. 2 Press out the bubbles. Heat the bubbled area with a hair dryer to soften the film adhesive. Use a credit card or small squeegee to press out the bubbles. 3 Re-adhere peeling parts. Make a solution out of dish soap and water. Wash the back of the peeling film with the soap and water solution. Use a squeegee to smooth the film back over the window. Allow the film to dry thoroughly. 4 Remove the tinting job. Cut heavy black garbage bag to the size of your window. If 1 bag is not large enough to cover your window, you may use more than 1 bag. Wet the outside of the window you are fixing and place the black bag against the window. The bag should cover the entire window and the water should keep it in place. Cover the entire back seat and the inside, under-window deck with a tarp. Spray the entirety of the inside window surface (the tinted side) liberally with ammonia. Park the car in the sun, allowing for the window to heat up under the black garbage back, and leave it sitting for about an hour. Starting in a corner without a defroster line, use a razor blade to peel back the film. Spray ammonia to the film as needed to keep it damp and to keep the film\u0027s adhesive from drying again. The entire film should come off in 1 piece. If you have a steamer, you may skip the ammonia-soaking process and use the steamer to heat the tinted window and remove the film in the same way.

You may encounter several problems with a car horn including a horn that blows at a lower tone than is normal or a horn that does not blow at all. Fixing a broken car horn can often be a do-it-yourself project. However, when the damage requires that other parts of the car be removed, such as the driver side airbag, you will need to call in a professional. Ad Steps 1 Determine the problem with your horn. Identifying the type of broken car horn you have will help you decide how to approach the fix. 2 Pop the hood and have someone press the horn if it is sounding at low volume. Many cars have 2 or more horns. If the sound of the horn is low when you press it, 1 or more of the horns has stopped working. 3 Locate the horn or horns on the radiator core support or behind the car\u0027s grille. 4 Remove the wire connector. The horn should resemble a fuse with wires coming out of it. To remove the wire connector, press down on the lower end of the connector and then pull the wiring out. Remove the mounting bolt and the spade lugs, which are attached to the wiring. Clean the components and then reattach them. Ask your helper to honk the horn again. 5 Purchase a replacement horn if cleaning the horn parts does not fix your reduced sounding car horn. You may choose to replace the broken horn with the exact horn originally installed in the car or you may choose a universal car horn. No Sound 1 Check the fuse box if your horn will not make any sound. Read your owner\u0027s manual to find the location of your car\u0027s fuse box. Your owner\u0027s manual will also inform you of the specific fuse connected to the operation of the car horn. 2 Remove the fuse with a pair of tweezers, needle-nosed pliers, or a pair of regular pliers. You may also be able to remove the fuse with your fingers. Your fuse has failed if the metal strip inside it is broken. 3 Replace the fuse if it is faulty. You can purchase replacement fuses from an auto supply store. Install the appropriate fuse and then have your helper try the horn again. 4 Check to see if the airbag light is illuminated on the dashboard if there is no problem with your fuse. A problem with the airbag can result in a malfunctioning horn. If the airbag has expanded, it may be interfering with the component called a clock spring that allows power to reach the horn button from the relay coil which connects to the horn itself. 5 Take your vehicle to a professional mechanic if the airbag light is illuminated. If your airbag has expanded, a professional mechanic will need to remove and then properly reinstall the airbag. A mechanic can determine other possible issues with your horn if you have been unable to isolate the problem.

The following may help you discover the problem, but there is no way to cover every possibility. We will look at individual possible problems, and ways to check for them. Ad Steps Part 1 Check the battery and starter 1 Check the battery. If you do not have sufficient voltage and cranking power, the car simply won\u0027t start. The proper voltage is 12.6 volts for a normal car battery. You can test the voltage using a simple multimeter available at most hardware stores. 2 Have the battery tested. Most retail stores that sell batteries can load test them to make sure they have enough cranking amperage to start your engine. 3 Have someone attach booster cables to your battery if the engine seems to be turning over slower than normal. 4 Look at the battery cable connection\u0027s condition. Corroded or loose connections at the battery terminals will prevent the starter from getting enough amperage to start your engine. 5 Decide if the starter is the problem.If the battery seems charged, and the starter motor still doesn\u0027t turn the engine, or turn it fast enough to start the engine, the problem may be in your starter motor itself. Changing the starter is not too complicated, but if you decide to attempt this, try to find someone who has done it before to help you, or buy a do it yourself manual that has a description and pictures of what you need to do. Some cars such as Fords have starter solenoid mounted on the inside fender that you can test to see if the voltage is going through to the starter motor, if not, some times you can cross jump the solenoid and start the car. If the car engine is turning quick enough and doesn\u0027t try to start, next check the fuel input to the engine. Part 2 Checking the fuel system 1 Make sure you have fuel in your tank. Hopefully your fuel gauge is working, but some lose calibration, and will register remaining fuel when the tank is dry. You cannot open a true fuel injected system to look for fuel, but on older cars, you can remove the air filter from the breather housing by taking the wing nut or other fastener off the top and lifting the cover. Here, when you pump the accelerator pedal, you should see gasoline spray into the carburetor throttle body. 2 Many fuel injected gasoline engines have a test port on the fuel delivery line. Since the fuel pressure can be as high as 70 PSI in some vehicles, using a test gauge is the safest way to make sure you have a sufficient fuel supply for your engine to run. Some cars have electric fuel pumps situated in the gas tank, and if someone listens at the filler cap while you turn the ignition switch from off to run, they will hear the pump cycle on for a few seconds, then click off when the system pressure reaches the required level. This can tell you if the pump is not working. Changing the fuel pump is a difficult and possibly dangerous project, so you should take your car to a mechanic. 3 Check your fuel filter to make sure it is allowing fuel through it. Fuel filters can become clogged over time, and eventually it may not allow enough fuel through it to allow the engine to run. Changing fuel filters is much easier and less expensive than changing a fuel pump. Part 3 Test the ignition system 1 Remove a spark plug wire from your spark plug and use an insulated screwdriver to ground the metal fitting inside the spark plug boot to the engine, and have someone turn the engine over while you watch for a spark. You should have the metal screwdriver shaft about an eighth of an inch from a clean metal surface on the engine, and be careful not to touch any uninsulated parts of the tool while testing the plug. If you do not have a spark, you have an ignition circuit problem, and depending on the vintage of your vehicle, you may have to replace anything from a coil wire to an ignition CPU, or computer. You can also buy an inexpensive spark tester instead of using a screwdriver. This is a somewhat easier and safer method. 2 Look for damaged or loose ignition components. With newer vehicles, it would be difficult to describe in detail all of the ignition system parts, but generally speaking, you will have a coil (or individual coils for each cylinder of the engine), spark plug wires, and spark plugs. You may also have a distributor cap with a rotor button, condenser, and other parts that can fail.

Ask it here: Submit Tips Look at the wires, hoses, and other components under the hood. Often, one unplugged wire, or one broken vacuum or fuel line will be the problem, and these are simple and inexpensive to fix. Check the owner\u0027s manual for fuses, relays, and circuit breakers related to either fuel or ignition. You should be able to locate these and make sure they are not tripped or blown. In the relay block, you can exchange relays that are the same size from another component, such as the AC blower, to test the ignition relay. Listen to your engine when you crank it. If you hear a knocking sound, backfiring, or misfiring, you may have a flooded carburetor or a serious engine problems such as jumped timing or stuck or broken valves. It is not possible to cover all the reasons a car won\u0027t crank in this article, but if you are able to find a do it yourself book at a department store or auto parts supply, or your local library, they can help with specific problems. Even when your car doesn\u0027t start when you try the ignition, it may show a \"code\", or information stored in the computer, that can be accessed by a technician to find the source of your problem. This may be a \"check engine\" light, or other indicator. If the owner\u0027s manual doesn\u0027t list a fuse or relay for the fuel pump, your car has a mechanical pump, and the only way to check it is to remove a fuel line, and turn the engine over to see if gasoline comes out, but this is very dangerous! The best thing that you should do is to have a good mechanic check your car every month so that you can predict any problem in advance.Good luck! Warnings Be extremely careful with exposed spark plug wires, as they contain high-voltages and can be dangerous! Do not remove any wires or other electrical parts without disconnecting the negative (-) post of the battery. When testing for spark or doing anything else which requires turning the motor over while looking under the hood, be careful of the fan blades, belts, and other moving parts. Do not remove fuel lines unless you know how to bleed off the pressure in them, injected fuel systems are pressurized, and will blow off gasoline when they are uncoupled. Never turn the engine over or crank it with the breather cover removed. Fuel in the throttle body can ignite!

Fortunately, this usually does not signal a major repair to your vehicle, and it can generally be fixed through some relatively minor adjustments or repairs. Ad Steps 1 Consider the complexity of your car before beginning and take your car to a trusted repair shop. Modern cars (mid-nineties or later) have an ignition and fuel system that are in large part computer controlled, and it will be difficult for you to make any adjustments. You will want to take it into the shop to address this problem. 2 Check for check engine lights or maintenance required lights on the dash board instrument cluster. Any fuel or ignition problem in modern CPU controlled engine systems will likely cause a code to be displayed, a check engine light, or maintenance required light to come on. If you are not able to use a scan tool, or don\u0027t have access to one, many auto parts retailer offer the use of one free of charge. 3 The stall is likely caused by either a problem in the electrical system or in the fuel system. Your engine stops running because it is not igniting fuel in the cylinders. This occurs either because there is not any gas to ignite, or because it lacks the electrical charge to ignite it. Note that older, carburetor type fuel systems may have too much fuel entering the cylinders, a condition known as flooding. 4 Drive the car up and down steep hills. Does this change the performance of the engine, or cause it to stall? This might indicate a clogged fuel filter. Replacing the fuel filter can often be relatively cheap and easy once you find out where it is located. Note that some vehicles have fuel filters located in the gas tank, and can be very difficult to access. Diesel fuel filters and multi-fuel filters can cost over $100.00, U.S. 5 Does the car idle roughly and stall when at idle? If your car has a distributor, you may need to adjust the timing. With the right tools and know how, this is an easy and free task. If your vehicle has fuel injection, you can check the injector by using a screwdriver or mechanics scope. The injectors will make a clicking/snapping sound if working. No sound may indicate a bad injector. It could also indicate an electrical failure with the circuit that drives the fuel injector. Also, check the Ignition Control Module, which controls the timing of the voltage going to spark plugs, and supplies the spark to ignite the fuel/air mixture. 6 If your car has a distributor, you might consider changing the cap, rotor, wires and plugs. This is effectively a tune-up. This can usually be done even by a relative novice to car repair, and take a couple of hours with the right tools. It seems counterintuitive, but even the wires and distributor decay over time, and transmit less electricity. This tune-up may solve your stalling problem — even if it does not, your car should run better and get better mileage afterwards. 7 If your car diesels when you turn off the ignition, it means that your car most likely has a carburetor and the idle speed adjustment is too high. Dieseling describes the situation where you turn off the key, yet the car continues to run for a few seconds or longer, eventually sputtering to a stop. This does not occur on fuel-injected vehicles because when the ignition is turned off so is the fuel supply to the engine as well as the spark plugs. 8 In rare cases, your car may stall due to what is commonly called a \"vapor lock,\" a situation that occurs when the fuel lines supplying gas to the engine become hot enough to boil the gas in the line turning it into vapor. Fuel pumps are designed to pump liquid not “vapor” and thus fail to provide enough fuel pressure. However, a clogged fuel tank vent system can cause a vacuum in the fuel line that causes fuel to eventually stop reaching the engine. This also is a problem unique to carbureted engines. Fuel injected engines commonly have \"closed loop\" fuel delivery systems that make this condition unlikely to occur. Try opening your gas cap. If you hear a \"whooshing\" sound, like when you open a can of coffee, it means the gas tank is not venting properly. Now try starting the car. It should work after a couple tries. This is usually found only in older cars. If you have it, this will probably happen again, so your tank vent system should be checked for blockage. More often than not, the problem can be traced to a cheap replacement locking gas cap. A cheap fix is to drill a small hole in your gas cap to allow air in and prevent the vacuum from forming, but the gas cap should not be left this way.

Video Tips If you can find a friend who knows how to work on cars, ask them to teach you how to do these things. Certain modern cars may stall on hot days due to the fuel pump. The fuel pump is located at the back of the gas tank, and is cooled by the gasoline itself. On hot days where the car has been running for a while, the fuel pump may overheat and stop working, stalling the car. To prevent this issue, always keep the gas tank at least 3/8 full, or else you might find yourself calling a friend to bring you a gas can! Tune-up: most people do not know that a tune-up has changed entirely since the days of points and condensers. Now, besides spark plugs and fuel filters, Oxygen sensors should be replaced at 100k miles. This alone will improve fuel economy more than anything besides tire inflation. They will cause stalling as well if they are not functioning correctly. Another very important thing to check is to see if the Mass Air Flow sensor is dirty. This will cause poor performance and possible stalling. They can be cleaned with mass air flow sensor cleaner which is essentially quick dry electronic cleaner. Many newer vehicles with fuel injection have an idle air control valve. These can/will become dirty and sticky over time and cause idling and stalling issues. Most can be removed and cleaned with a throttle body cleaner. A carbon fouled throttle body can cause poor idling and stalling as well. Warnings Working on your car can be dangerous.

The main purpose of a locked wheel is to prevent vehicle movement when there is no key, or if the wrong key is inserted into the ignition. This helps to deter vehicle theft, while also providing a strong measure of safety when towing or hauling a vehicle. However, ignition tumblers experience a lot of mechanical movement and force over time and often fail, preventing the steering wheel from unlocking. Ad Steps Method 1 Loosening Sticky Locks 1 Loosen up sticky locks with graphite powder. Ignition locks normally become difficult to turn or unlock long before they completely fail. To prolong an ignition tumbler\u0027s life, apply graphite powder inside the keyhole when regular vehicle maintenance is performed. 2 Try pulling the steering wheel left and right while turning the key. Tumblers that haven’t jammed solid can sometimes be worked free by pulling the steering wheel left and right while turning the key on and off. This technique usually works a few times before the ignition lock assembly proves unsuccessful at releasing the tumblers lock pin. 3 Use a release agent like WD-40. Applying a release agent like WD-40 may also help to release the steering wheel. However, this is only a stop-gap measure and you should plan on replacing the ignition lock cylinder as soon as possible after the steering wheel begins to jam. Method 2 Replacing the Ignition Lock Assembly 1 Understand how the ignition lock works. Ignition locks work by engaging a small steel pin inserted into a corresponding hole on the steering column, providing a simple lock effect. When the ignition key is turned forward to the “on” position, this lock-pin retracts into the tumbler (out of the hole in the steering column) and frees the steering wheel. However, if the steering wheel lock-pin fails to retract, the ignition tumbler needs replacement. 2 Purchase a new ignition lock assembly. Ignition assemblies are easily replaced in most vehicles and can be done at home. Vehicle manufacturers don’t change part numbers often and obtaining the correct replacement from part stores, is not usually an issue. Purchase a new ignition lock assembly prior to removal of failed assembly. Compare and verify the replacement is an identical match before attempting reinstallation. 3 Remove the cover covering the ignition. Generally, most vehicles have a split-plastic housing that covers the steering column and ignition lock assembly. Remove this plastic cover by first adjusting the tilt-wheel to it’s lowest position. If it\u0027s not equipped, remove the steering column support brace under the dashboard and allow the column to hang. Remove the fasteners from the column cover, separate the two halves and remove. 4 Use an allen wrench to release the ignition assembly. Identify the ignition assembly and remove any components that prevent access to the ignition wire harness connector and tumbler release hole. Ignition tumblers have a tiny hole where an inserted 9/32” allen wrench releases the assembly while turning the ignition key backwards, simultaneously. Release the tumbler and pull the key out along with the ignition assembly, taking care to unplug the ignition switch wire connector together. 5 Ensure the new ignition switch is well-greased. Once the ignition assembly is removed, compare the new switch and ensure they match. Installation is simply the reverse of removal. New ignition switches come pre-lubed from the factory ready to install. Verify the presence of grease on all external moving parts and ensure the new key fits and that the cylinder rotates smoothly in both directions. It does not harm the tumbler to apply a moderate amount of white lithium grease to moving parts, if they are found to be dry. 6 Ensure that the internal lock pins can move freely. Ensure free movement of the the internal lock pins by inserting the key completely in and out of keyhole several times. Sticking lock pins are lubricated using powdered graphite that is applied directly inside the keyhole. Graphite comes in small tubes designed to “squirt” the powder with enough force to reach the back of any keyhole. It can be added when needed. 7 Slide the cylinder into place and reconnect the switch plug. When satisfied the new assembly is correct and properly lubricated, slide cylinder into position and make sure it is locked in place. Reconnect the switch plug and reinstall any parts previously removed. 8 Start the engine to ensure the steering wheel lock disengages. Before securing the steering column (if disconnected) and plastic cover, check for proper engine start and steering wheel lock engage/disengage. Steering column bolts usually have torque specifications which are located in the vehicle’s repair manual, in the specification section. If no torque specs are found, tighten bolts firmly using a long handled ratchet for leverage. Column bolts can not be allowed to vibrate loose while driving, allowing the loss of steering control. 9 Consult your car\u0027s repair manual for specific instructions. This procedure is the standard for most foreign and domestic vehicle’s, however there is always new technology and design introduced every year by manufacturers. In the case a vehicle does not follow the standard replacement procedure to replace the vehicle ignition assembly, consult the vehicle’s repair manual for specific instructions.

Problems with window operation can be as simple as checking the fuses, or making sure the lockout switches are receiving voltage. A common occurrence with the power window on the Cherokee is that the screw in the regulator, sometimes called a \"worm screw,\" becomes loose or detached. The regulator itself also may be damaged. In this case, the motor will run, but the window won\u0027t operate. You can remove the inside plastic front of the door to fix the problem, which is more cost efficient than taking it to a dealer for repairs. Use these tips to learn how to fix a power window on a Jeep Cherokee Ad Steps Method 1 Troubleshoot the Electrical System 1 Ensure that the problem with the window isn\u0027t a blown fuse. Check all fuses at the driver\u0027s kick panel for burned out filaments. They will appear gray in color or look burned. 2 Replace blown fuses. Replace any fuses that are blown and try to power the window. If the wiring is receiving voltage, you will be able to hear the motor, despite the window not being operable. Method 2 Replace the Regulator 1 Remove the door panel of the window that won\u0027t work. Locate the screw underneath the door handle. Pull up the handle and remove the screw with a screwdriver. 2 Remove the plastic panel from the door frame. Use a flat-head screwdriver to pry the plastic panel out from the door frame. Pull carefully so as not to break the plastic. 3 Disconnect all parts connected to the plastic door frame. Disconnect the power window cable, the mirror cable and the lock controls. Locate the plastic clasps that cover the exposed and attached lock mechanisms. Pull the clasps up and turn until the rods in the mechanisms pull straight up. 4 Remove the 4 screws and connector plugs of the speaker. 5 Remove the black, plastic cover that sits between the door and the plastic panel. Carefully pull it off by hand, leaving the black adhesive attached. 6 Access the regulator to detach the window from it. Remove the interior rubber seal at the bottom of the window groove and locate the regulator inside of the hole. Locate the metal clip holding the regulator to the plastic receiver. Pull out the pin on both sides of the clip. 7 Pull out the window. Turn the window upside down so that it comes out top first. 8 Detach the window motor from the regulator and motor. Disconnect the plugs that attach the power controls to the window motor and locate the 4 screws that attach the regulator to the door. Unscrew 3 of the screws, leaving the top left screw loose so it will hang in place. Locate the 3 screws to the motor and do the same thing. 9 Remove the regulator and motor assembly. Gently pull the regulator and motor assembly, which are still attached, from the screw holes and tilt them inside the door, removing them from the hole. 10 Detach the motor from the regulator. Unscrew the 3 screws that hold the motor to the regulator. Discard the regulator. 11 Replace the regulator. Place the new regulator where the old one was and reattach it to the motor assembly. 12 Reinstall the door in reverse order.

The problem lies with the ribbon cable that connects the LCD to the panel. Once you replace it to a real silver \"pixel fix cable\" it will work perfectly for years. Ad Steps 1 Remove the unit from the car: 2 Remove the front cover of the unit: The unit has 5 plastic crosses on the back, that hold the front cover on the unit. Rotate all 5 crosses counterclockwise with your pliers about 15 degrees so they will line up with the gaps below them You may have to overturn it a bit, so when released it will stop in the position you need. Make sure you do it on all 5 positions! 3 Remove all 8 screws from the unit: use your torx screwdriver 4 To get access to your LCD without removing the needles (which would require recalibration), the only way is to make 4 little holes on the front plastic layer. Do not worry, NO VISIBLE DAMAGE WILL REMAIN! You will need to drill through a thin plastic layer, so do not use a powerful drill - an electric screwdriver with a drill bit will do the job quite easily. Locate the positions as show on the pictures below. If you did this job well, you will see the head of the torx screw through the hole. There are 4 holes located slightly above the LCD. 5 Unscrew the 4 screws through the holes you just drilled: 6 Remove the back. Loosen up the little claws under the black cover in 2 places: where the screwdriver shows, and also where the little white arrow is. If you did the job, it will “click” and will lift a bit. Release the claws at the electrical connectors using a small screwdriver by levering the screwdriver Down the side and tilting up – all connectors have 4 on each corner. 7 If all 4 screws were removed that held the LCD, you can smoothly remove the plastic stand. Be gentle,as it might stick to the panel, but with the small screwdriver you can loosen it up. Important: the 6 small connectors are NOT soldered. These are so called \"press-fit\" connectors, which means they were simply pressed into the panel, no soldering was applied. After removing the plastic stand, the original ribbon cable is still holding it. Now you need to peel it off nice and slowly. Do not worry, you do not need the original ribbon cable anymore! 8 Remove the LCD from the plastic stand. This is just 5 clips to be released slowly. There are 3 clips where the ribbon cable is, and there are other 2 on the other side: Be Careful and do not break the LCD glass! From this point on you need to be very careful! 9 Now you need to remove smoothly the original ribbon from the LCD glass, and clean it from any residual material. Simple peel it off. When cleaning the LCD, do not use acetone! You may use a credit card\u0027s corner, your fingernail, or a box cutter\u0027s blade. Panel: The best is to clean it with acetone and q-tips. 10 Place paper slices (cut to fit) under all the silicone spacers (lift out the silicone, put the paper in, and the silicone goes back to the top). This is quite important to make sure the pressure will be appropriate after the final assembly. Photo paper has optimal thickness for this purpose. 3 small to the 3 small silicone strips, and a 4th one under the long strip which is under the LCD. 11 Place the new ribbon cable onto the panel. The panel\u0027s pads are already perfectly cleaned so now we need to place the new ribbon cable on it so that the pads of the cable very accurately meet the pads of the panel. To do so, put the cable on the edge of your desk exactly as the picture below shows, and put scotch tape on it. Put the cable onto the panel - make sure the pads of the panel accurately meet the pads of the cable. 12 Now put the stand back, and also the 4 screws that hold it 13 Now remove the orange backing paper from the silicone spacer provided, you will find that there is adhesive under it. Place it against the plastic stand. Important: the adhesive side goes to the original silicone spacer, so it will stick to it, not the plastic! 14 LCD back on board: Now you need to put the LCD back - make sure the pads of the LCD match the pads of the ribbon.Put the frame back, while you keep pushing the LCD. The 2 clips on the bottom will click in quite easily, but the 3 additional ones on the other side of the frame will have to be pushed down with the flat head screwdriver. Push them down with the flat head screwdriver until they click and make a sound quite easy to hear and feel. Do not push the surface of the frame, only at the little holes located at the 2 arms of the frame. 15 Put the cover back, put the unit back into the car, and ENJOY Reader Questions and Answers Unanswered Questions Show more unanswered questions Add New Question Answered Questions Don\u0027t see your question?

If your car is showing uneven or unusually rapid tire wear, is pulling to one side or vibrating when you drive, or if your steering column doesn\u0027t seem straight, there\u0027s a good chance your wheels are out of alignment.[1] Using the following steps, you can diagnose common alignment problems with your car and correct the most common one, front-end alignment issues, at home. Ad Steps Part 1 Preparing to Measure 1 Check your tire pressure. Your tires should be appropriately and evenly inflated before you proceed. Tires that are not properly inflated may actually be the cause of your performance issues, so it\u0027s a good idea to check this first. You may not need to do anything else. Additionally, having your tires inflated properly is important for getting accurate reads on the measurements you\u0027ll be taking later. 2 Check your specifications. Look in your car\u0027s repair manual for details about the proper alignment settings. You should find numbers describing the car\u0027s ideal toe, camber, and possibly caster. Write these numbers down. You may not know what these numbers mean yet, but don\u0027t worry, this will be explained in parts 2 and 3. For now, just make sure you transcribe them accurately. 3 Check the front end suspension. If your suspension is loose or any parts have worn out, this may also be the cause of your problems. Like tire-pressure issues, problems with your suspension can also throw off your measurements, so it\u0027s important to take care of any issues here first. Drive the car onto a flat area, jack up the front end, and place the car on jack stands. Make sure the steering wheel is unlocked. The easiest way to check the suspension once the car is lifted is to grip each wheel and shake it, both horizontally and vertically. If you don\u0027t feel much movement, your suspension is probably in good shape. If not, this may be the source of your problem.[2] If the suspension is loose, you must replace any worn parts. This could include bad ball joints, rack, bushings, gear boxes, tie rod ends, or steering pads. Unless you have experience doing suspension work, you will probably need to take your car to a professional mechanic. Part 2 Measuring Your Toe 1 Determine the proper toe. Toe is the amount by which the wheels are closer (toe-in) or further apart (toe-out) at their front edges than at their rear edges, as viewed from above.[3]Depending on your car, your manual will probably recommend either zero toe (equal distance between the front and back) or slight toe-in, which increases stability.[4] Toe is the source of most alignment problems, and the easiest to correct yourself.[5] 2 Draw a line. With the car still up on the jack, hold a pocketknife, thin piece of chalk, or white pencil against the center of tire tread. Hold your hand very still and have an assistant turn the tire one full turn, creating a line around the circumference. Do the same on the other side. If there is no area on the tire where the tread is flat, you may need to suspend your marking tool with a clamp or similar stabilizer.[6] 3 Lower the car. After you lower the car to the ground, push down on the car above each wheel a few times to allow the car to settle. 4 Roll the car. Push the car forward at least 10 feet with the steering wheel unlocked to make sure the wheels are straight. 5 Stretch a string. With an assistant, take a piece of string or wire and stretch it between the lines on the front of the tires, even with the spindle, and measure the distance on the string. Repeat at the process at the back of each tire. As long as you use string or wire that does not stretch, you can get a very accurate measurement this way.[7] 6 Subtract the differences. If the distance in the front is smaller than in the back, your wheels toe-in. If the measurement in the back is smaller, they toe-out. If they are identical, you have zero toe.[8] Rear toe is also important for control and tire life. It is also important to have your front and rear wheels aligned with one another (e.g. parallel).[9] You can measure your rear toe similarly to the front. If your rear toe is out of alignment, you may need to see a professional mechanic. Rear toe should be adjusted before front toe, so if you find a problem with the rear, don\u0027t waste time adjusting the front yourself.[10] Part 3 Measuring Your Camber 1 Determine the right camber. Camber is the vertical angle of the wheels when looking at the car head on.[11] Wheels that are closer together at the top are considered to have \"negative\" camber, those closer together at the bottom have \"positive\" camber.[12]Depending on your car, the manual will probably recommend slight negative camber, as this increases stability. 2 Cut a measuring triangle. Get a piece of stiff cardboard or wood and cut it into a perfect right triangle (one with a 90 degree angle) that is the same height as your wheels. 3 Place the triangle. Starting in the front of the car, put the base of the triangle on the ground, perpendicular to the car, and the other side of the 90 degree angle against the center of one of the wheels.[13] 4 Take your measurement. There will be a gap between your measuring device and your tire, probably at the top. Measure this with a ruler or calipers. This is your camber.[14] Repeat with the other front wheel. The two wheels should be about the same and within the range specified by your manual. If not, your camber may need alignment. Repeat the process in the back. If you think the camber is off, move your car forward or backward enough to spin the tires half a turn, then try measuring again.[15] Problems with camber, front or rear, can affect how your car handles.[16]. At the same time, however, unless your car has been in a serious accident, it is unlikely that your camber will be seriously out of alignment.[17] If your camber does need to be corrected, it should be done before adjusting the toe.[18] Camber cannot typically be corrected at home with ordinary tools,[19] and indeed, for some cars it cannot be adjusted at all without bending or replacing major parts.[20] Unless you have experience with automotive repair and professional tools, do not try to adjust this yourself. Part 4 Correcting Your Toe 1 Locate your tie rod ends. The tie rods are the connection between your steering system and your wheels.[21] The rod ends are L-shaped parts sometimes found near the inside of the wheel. It\u0027s a good idea to look at your car\u0027s manual and/or at some pictures on the internet to get a sense of what tie rod ends look like and where exactly they are located on your specific car. 2 Loosen the lock nuts. Between the tie rod and each tie rod end is a nut that holds it in place. You\u0027ll need to loosen this nut with a wrench. Be aware that on some vehicles, the driver\u0027s side lock nut may be threaded counterclockwise, while the passenger side is threaded clockwise.[22] Depending on your steering system, there may also be a clamp that needs to be removed at each end to make sure the bellows boot is not sticking to the inner tie rod.[23] Consult your manual for details. If it has been a long time since you had an alignment, the threaded parts may be stubborn and require some lubrication, such as WD40, in order to make them turn.[24] 3 Make your adjustments. Depending on the type of steering you have, there are two different ways you can adjust your toe. If you have rack and pinion steering, you should turn the inner tie rod itself. Spinning the rod will adjust the toe in or out.[25] If you have a parallelogram linkage system, there will be adjusting sleeves that you can turn to adjust your toe. These sleeves can be damaged by this process, so be careful. There are special tools for rotating tie rods which can prevent damage.[26] Whichever system you have, make sure to keep in mind that the change you are making to the toe will be distributed across two wheels. Each tie rod should be adjusted 1/2 of the total desired amount of change in or out. 4 Re-check the toe. Tighten your nuts (and clamps, if applicable) back up. Then, recheck the toe using the same procedures you followed in part 2. Readjust as necessary. Unless you are well practiced at this, there may be a certain amount of trial and error to get this right. 5 Test drive the car. Take the car for a drive to verify that any obvious alignment issues have been corrected (e.g. that the car does not pull to one side or vibrate excessively). If your alignment problems persist, you may have a problem that requires a professional mechanic.

Ask it here: Submit Video Tips In addition to camber and toe, there is a third alignment measure called caster. Caster is the angle of the steering axis when viewed from the side of the car.[27] Caster is very difficult to measure without specialized tools and impossible to adjust at home.[28] Indeed, for many cars, the caster is not adjustable at all without replacing your suspension. If a toe correction does not solve your problems, it is possible caster needs to be adjusted. A mechanic will be able to tell you if this is necessary or even possible. The modern alignment machines used by the professionals is the most accurate way to measure and adjust your vehicle\u0027s total alignment. There are commercially available devices that can be use to measure camber. If you are having trouble making your camber measurements using the method described, you may find one of these easier to use.[29] Warnings After you jack up the car, make sure it is very stable before you climb underneath, and in particular before you start shaking your wheels to check the suspension. If the car were to fall off the jack stands, you could be badly injured or even killed. The total alignment of today\u0027s modern cars consists of several angles and measurements all working together. If the adjustments are done incorrectly, handling can be negatively affected and may cause a safety issue in extreme situations.

Here\u0027s a short guide to how air conditioning (AC) works, why it might not work, and what you can do about it. Ad Steps Method 1 Understanding Car Air Conditioning 1 Realize that auto AC is basically a refrigerator in a weird layout. It\u0027s designed to move heat from one place (the inside of your car) to some other place (the outdoors). While a complete discussion of every specific model and component is well outside the scope of this article, the following explanations of auto air conditioning should give you a start on figuring out what the problem might be. This should also help you work with the right pieces if fixing it yourself or it will help you to talk intelligently to someone you can pay to fix it. 2 Become familiar with the major components to auto air conditioning: Compressor: This compresses and circulates the refrigerant in the system Refrigerant: On modern cars, this is usually a substance called R-134a, while older cars have r-12 freon which is becoming increasingly more expensive and hard to find, and also requires a license to handle. The refrigerant carries the heat. Condenser: This changes the phase of the refrigerant from gas to liquid and expels heat removed from the car. Expansion valve (or orifice tube in some vehicles): This is somewhat of a nozzle and functions to simultaneously drop the pressure of the refrigerant liquid, meter its flow, and atomize it. Evaporator: This transfers heat to the refrigerant from the air blown across it, cooling your car. Receiver/dryer: This functions as a filter for the refrigerant/oil, removing moisture and other contaminants. 3 Understand the air conditioning process. In a nutshell, the compressor puts the refrigerant under pressure and sends it to the condensing coils. In your car, these coils are generally in front of the radiator. Compressing a gas makes it quite hot. In the condenser, this added heat and the heat the refrigerant picked up in the evaporator is expelled to the air flowing across it from outside the car. When the refrigerant is cooled to its saturation temperature, it will change phase from a gas back into a liquid (this gives off a bundle of heat known as the \"latent heat of vaporization\"). The liquid then passes through the expansion valve to the evaporator, the coils inside of your car, where it loses pressure that was added to it in the compressor. This causes some of the liquid to change to a low-pressure gas as it cools the remaining liquid. This two-phase mixture enters the evaporator, and the liquid portion of the refrigerant absorbs the heat from the air across the coil and evaporates. Your car\u0027s blower circulates air across the cold evaporator and into the interior. The refrigerant goes back through the cycle again and again. Method 2 Fixing the AC 1 Check to see if all the R-134a leaks out (meaning there\u0027s nothing in the loop to carry away heat). Leaks are easy to spot but not easy to fix without pulling things apart. Most auto-supply stores carry a fluorescent dye that can be added to the system to check for leaks, and it will have instructions for use on the can. If there\u0027s a bad enough leak, the system will have no pressure in it at all. Find the low-side valve and with a gauge check the PSI level. Yellow glasses and a ultraviolet light will be needed to find leaks with dye. Electronic leak detectors are also available. Do not use anything else to poke in the valve to see if it will come out, this is illegal. It\u0027s called venting. 2 Make sure the compressor is turning. Start the car, turn on the AC and look under the hood. The AC compressor is generally a pump-like thing off to one side with large rubber and steel hoses going to it. It will not have a filler cap on it, but will often have one or two things that look like the valve stems on a bike tire. The pulley on the front of the compressor exists as an outer pulley and an inner hub which turns when an electric clutch is engaged. If the AC is on and the blower is on, but the center of the pulley is not turning, then the compressor\u0027s clutch is not engaging. This could be a bad fuse, a wiring problem, a broken AC switch in your dash, or the system could be low on refrigerant (most systems have a low-pressure safety cutout that will disable the compressor if there isn\u0027t enough refrigerant in the system). 3 Look for other things that can go wrong. The other sorts of problems that the AC might be experiencing include: bad switches, bad fuses, broken wires, broken fan belt (preventing the pump from turning), or seal failure inside the compressor. 4 Feel for any cooling at all. If the system cools, but not much, it could just be low pressure and you can top up the refrigerant. Most auto-supply stores will have a kit to refill a system, complete with instructions. Do not overfill! Adding more than the recommended amount of refrigerant will not improve performance but actually will decrease performance. In fact, the more expensive automated equipment found at nicer shops actually monitors cooling performance in real-time as it adds refrigerant. When the performance begins to decrease it removes refrigerant until the performance peaks again.

The compressor may be low on refrigerant. If it keeps trying to switch on, but without enough gas, the compressor cycles off again. Check your compressor pulley to see if it is turning. Most likely, according to your description, the pulley will spin for a second or two, then stop. Check refrigerant pressure and add coolant, and check for leaks. Helpful? Thanks! 0 0 Don\u0027t see your question? Ask it here: Submit Tips If you suspect bad wiring, most compressors have a wire leading to the electric clutch. Find the connector in the middle of that wire, and unplug it. Take a length of wire and run it from the compressor\u0027s wire to the plus (+) side of your battery. If you hear a loud CLACK, the electric clutch is fine and you should check the car\u0027s wiring and fuses. If you get nothing, the electric clutch is bad and the compressor will have to be replaced. Ideally, if you can do this test while the car is running, you can see if the hub spins. Take care to keep fingers and loose clothes away from moving pulleys and belts. That would rule out a clutch that actuates properly but then slips so badly it won\u0027t generate pressure. Another possible replacement refrigerant is HC12a which is used quite a bit more in Europe. It performs better than R-134a or R12. It is more flammable. HC12a is illegal in many U.S. states, including Arkansas, Arizona, Connecticut, Florida, Idaho, Iowa, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia. HC12a has a lesser environmental impact than R12 or R134a, but since HC12a contains hydrocarbons, it could contribute to volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions. This substance must be ordered on the Internet as local shops do not seem to stock it. The issue is that shops will not work on a car that has other refrigerants in it. Special equipment is needed for each type of refrigerant\u0027s recovery. Standard R12 or R134a is a safer choice. If your car has an air conditioner leak even though the drain pipe is clean, some water may have entered the AC system during a drive through rain. Your system will have a light oil in it. Sometimes the problem is not always about the refrigerant. There may be a problem with heat radiation from nearby engine which is very hot and decrease the AC efficiency and performance. You can try to wrap / isolate the cold AC pipe near the engine to stop engine heat radiation from affecting the pipe and increase ac performance overall.[1] Warnings If you have any reason to suspect that your refrigerant has leaked out completely (the DIY pressure gauge you bought at the parts store reads 0 psi; the compressor won\u0027t engage because it may be sensing no pressure in the system; you checked the gauge and have no PSI level ), then you are best off taking it to a professional unless you are familiar with what you are doing. As a general rule of thumb, you are probably not familiar enough if you are reading this article. The reason for this is that a completely depleted refrigerant system has no pressure to keep air and moisture from coming in through wherever the refrigerant leaked out. Air and moisture are possibly the two biggest enemies of an air conditioning system. The ways in which they can do harm are outside the scope of this article, but suffice it to say that it is not okay to have a significant amount of either in the lines. The receiver/dryer unit must be replaced in a case like this as you can almost guarantee that it has absorbed enough moisture to be completely useless, and before refilling the system it must be evacuated (pulling a vacuum on the system, effectively removing nearly all air and moisture from inside) with the proper equipment, which few DIYers are likely to have access or knowledge to use. Let a professional handle it, and you may get away with paying for a fixed leak and an evacuate/recharge. Try to fix it yourself, and a few months down the road you might wind up having to pay for the same evacuate/recharge service, plus replacement of a seized compressor, as well as a new condenser, evaporator, and expansion valve/orifice tube because the compressor sent shards of metal throughout the entire system when it died. HC12 and R-134A are non-flammable at ambient temperatures and atmospheric pressure, but both may combust at high pressure and temperature under certain conditions (in contact with certain reactive metals). Both also displace oxygen, so do not release a lot of the gas in a small, non-vented area under penalty of asphyxiation. Look out for moving fan blades and fan belts! Stay away from major leaks of refrigerant. As it vents, it will get cold enough to freeze your skin, resulting in frostbite. Never connect refrigerant cans, oil or leak-detector cans to the \"high pressure side\" of the system. This is often marked with H or HIGH, or a red connector cap. Cans can explode, and that would hurt. You may not find a repair facility that will simply top you off, if they suspect that you need to repair a leak first. If you repaired the leaks and failed components yourself, it is legal to recharge the system with 134 without a license, but not R-12. However, getting a license to handle R-12 is easy online, and runs about $20.) Checking for refrigerant by poking something in the fitting and looking for venting may be illegal if it releases refrigerant into the atmosphere. (Please don\u0027t do this with R-12 especially!) While it is not illegal to top off a leaking system, you must check your local regulations, as in some cases there is a state or local law against it, due to the possible emissions.[2] Venting refrigerant, even R-134a, is illegal in the United States, so act accordingly. Be extremely cautious about converting your old R-12 system to R-134a. The R-134a conversion kits sold at Auto Parts stores and even WalMart, are called \"Black Death Kits\" by some AC repairmen. Frequently, the new R-134a refrigerant will not circulate the R-12 oil and you will burn up your compressor. The R-12 mineral oil has chlorine contaminants that will destroy the R-134a PAG or POE special oil. The only way to reliably convert from R-12 to R-134a is to remove the compressor and flush out all the old oil with the new type of oil; then replace the old Receiver-Dryer or Accumulator with a new one; then flush out all the lines, the evaporator, and the condenser with special cleaner then vacuum to a steady vacuum; and finally charge with 70-80%, (by weight) of the original R-12 weight, with R-134a; and expect poorer cooling ability. It is much easier to keep the old R-12 system running with R-12 that is readily available via eBay. You must have a license to buy and sell R-12. Note that the above warning is controversial. Some repairmen claim to have converted hundreds of vehicles from R-12 to R134a without any problems or issues or failures after conversion.

Check with your auto-repair shop or State Department of Motor Vehicles for local requirements to acquire a smog certificate. Not every vehicle needs to get a smog check, but if you live in California or a handful of other progressive states or counties, you may have to pass their smog check requirements in order to have your vehicle registered with the state. The requirements will be determined by the make and model of your vehicle as well as where it is to be registered. Ad Steps 1 Understand why your vehicle needs to undergo a smog check. In an effort to reduce carbon emissions that lead to global warming, many states are being proactive in regulating pollutants being emitted through your automobile exhaust system. 2 Take a look at DMV.org, \"The Unofficial Site of the DMV,\" at http://www.dmv.org/smog-check.php to determine if your state has smog check requirements. This site tells you which counties in each state have smog check requirements and what vehicles need to be tested. 3 Check out California state resources to determine if there are smog check requirements for your vehicle. California\u0027s Smog Check program was created to help California have cleaner air as well as to help the state meet the requirements of the Federal Clean Air Act. Sites such as the State of California Department of Consumer Affairs Bureau of Automotive Repair can give you detailed information to help get you started. 4 Look for notification in the mail. In California, for example, your registration renewal notification will state \"Smog Certification Required.\" 5 Know what to take for your smog check. If you are doing your smog check to renew your registration, then take your vehicle, your registration renewal paperwork and your payment. If you are transferring a vehicle to a state that has a smog check requirement or your vehicle is being registered for the first time in a state with smog check requirements, you will need to not only bring your vehicle and your payment, but all necessary registration information as well. 6 Understand what takes place at your smog test. A certified technician will apply the necessary measurement tools to your vehicle, at which point, he or she will perform the test. In some states, these testing facilities have direct access to your state\u0027s department of motor vehicles and will immediately transmit the results to them. If not, get a copy of your emissions report signed by your mechanic and send it to the DMV.

Often there are exclusions of certain items in the \"fine print\". Don\u0027t give up too easily, though, some of these exclusions are regulated by laws which vary from state to state. 2 Keep detailed records of all maintenance required on your purchase. In the case of an automobile, this will include oil changes, lubrication, the engine air filter, and possibly other things pertaining to a specific vehicle. You will have very little luck settling a warranty dispute if the maintenance schedule has not been followed and documented. 3 Keep all paperwork that supports your claim, including sales receipts and prior warranty work which has been covered. On some occasion, a replacement part or service work may have an extended warranty for that particular item. 4 Notify the warranty department of the seller immediately when the problem occurs. Some minor problems manage to become major ones if not dealt with properly. An example would be a car with low engine oil pressure. If this is corrected, it can be a simple repair, but if left uncorrected, it will cause engine failure. 5 Do not let the service people talk you into partial repairs, or using rebuilt or after-market parts. They will sometimes do this to cut cost, but most warranty work calls for factory replacement parts. 6 Talk to the salesperson who sold you the item if the service department refuses to help you. Remind him/her of any promises they made when selling the product, and try to get them to stand behind their product. 7 Go to the store manager or owner, if possible, and make your case as honestly and forthright as possible. Let them know you will go to the top of the corporate ladder if needed...and follow through. 8 Hit the internet. Visit the corporate website, look for executive email addresses and FAQ (frequently asked question) links. Write an email detailing the problem, your perspective on why it is a warranty issue, and a description of the response you got from the dealer or seller. Stick to the facts, the date of purchase, the implied warranty if there was one, and the exact nature of the problem. 9 Go to government and public service websites. When dealing with car problems, go to car websites, and look for Technical Service Bulletins and Recalls. Often, the manufacturer does not want to admit a defect exists, but over a period of time, the industry and any federal government agencies with jurisdiction on the product will force action to remedy common problems, especially safety issues. 10 Use good judgment. Do not fight a long uphill battle over a small repair charge, but do not compromise safety or quality of life out of stubbornness to make the manufacturer pay for the problem. 11 Keep records of repair costs and loss of use, if you are forced to pay to have the repairs done. You may continue to have problems with the item, and even be forced to take legal action. In this case, documentation may allow you to recover all your costs, and repayment for lost use.

Car dealers, especially, will occasionally, hopefully rarely, deny there is a problem, but when confronted with a mechanic\u0027s diagnosis of the problem, relent and correct it. Consider purchasing an extended warranty when making a major purchase that involves long term financing. Even when purchasing a new home, extended warranties can cover everything from appliances to structural elements of the home. Some credit card issuers offer double warranty period if you use their card. Keep all receipts and warranty papers for any purchase you may later need warranty work or replacement for. Small, cheap, or disposable items may not be worth the trouble. Warnings Watch out for yourself if you make an expensive purchase \"As is\", this means the product carries no warranty.

Does your mechanic seem to talk over you, or try to convince you that you\u0027re imagining problems? Even if your knowledge about cars is just about zilch, there are ways to cut to the chase and get the results you want. Ad Steps 1 Before you go in, call about the problem so that you can find out what kind of questions they\u0027re likely to ask or what information they\u0027ll need from you when you take your car in for its service. 2 Ask the service manager when is the best time to bring your car in so that you can have an unhurried chat about your vehicle. 3 Go over the problems with him and give him a written report of the problems. 4 If he doesn\u0027t know what you are talking about, have him drive it around the block so that he can acknowledge and understand your concerns. Make notes on your list in his technical-speak to make sure you\u0027re both on the same page. 5 Leave the list with him. 6 When you pick up your car, drive it around the block to check that all the problems have been solved and bring it back straight away if any of the problems persist. 7 If your car is new and you have persistent problems that the service dealer cannot fix, call up the factory and arrange for their service department to look at it.

Video Tips Do get a second opinion, or at least call a second shop to check the prices you are being quoted at the first shop. If a mechanic sees that you don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about (or assumes it because you\u0027re a woman), they might try to rip you off at an disreputable garage. Agree on costs before you give the go ahead on any work. Ask to have your quote separated into necessary, immediate repairs and other maintenance recommended. Maintenance is important, but you want to separate fixing the current problem from preventing future problems. Ask about the warranty on the repair BEFORE the repair is performed. If you can, get someone who knows cars to come with you to the shop. The service advisor or mechanic will likely appreciate the help when you are explaining your problem(s) and when they are explaining the repairs back to you. When getting a second opinion, going to a local College, University, or Technical school, may be your best bet. Since they are using your car for training, they will rarely try to \"upsell\" you into things you don\u0027t need. Going to the local College, University, or Technical school, although cheap because you don\u0027t have to pay labor, may take longer than you would like to wait. (They also rarely do regular maintenance work, to not steal away your business from local auto-shops). Many car owners feel like the statement \"we were unable to duplicate your concern\" means the same thing as \"we think you are crazy\" or \"we would rather be doing nothing than work on your car.\" This is simply not the case with a quality repair facility. Repair facilities rely on finding your problem in order to make a living. Sometimes, \"we were unable to duplicate your concern\" means they spent some time trying to get it to do as you described and were unable to do so. Expect to pay some diagnostics charges before you can get a good quote for the necessary repairs.

Remember that the mechanic who quotes you the cheapest price for a particular repair may not be the best. There can be huge differences in the quality of parts being used and in the warranty provisions for the repair. Hopping from car dealer to car dealer hoping to find a miracle \"cure\" can be counter productive, sometimes it\u0027s better to stick with a team who knows your car\u0027s history.

Today, airbags systems are installed in every single car and can mean the difference between life and death in certain situations. Many serious injuries have been averted thanks to airbags. Once an airbag deploys, you cannot reuse it and therefore must replace it as soon as possible. Having some knowledge of replacing your car\u0027s airbags can be beneficial to the safety of you and your family. Ad Steps 1 Locate your car\u0027s user manual. There will be a section in the manual about airbags and replacing airbags. If you do not have the manual for your car, contact your car manufacturer for a replacement copy. 2 Practice safety measures. Turn off your car\u0027s battery and disconnect the negative cables before installing the airbag. Now wait for the capacitor in the airbags control module to completely discharge, about 10 to 15 minutes. The capacitor is what carries a charge that deploys the airbag system if your car is involved in a crash or accident. The airbag fuses must also be deactivated. Refer to your car\u0027s manual to locate the fuses. Touching the metal part of the connector of the new airbag could accidentally set it off with static electricity so carefully avoid touching it. 3 Check the collapsible steering column and the clock spring. Start by checking to see if there is a collapsible steering column in your car. Check your manual to help you find it. It is usually located between the plastic covering of the column and the back of the steering wheel. You will most likely need to replace the column if it is damaged. Check the clock spring. The clock spring is the connector that the driver\u0027s side airbag gets plugged into. You will also have to replace this if burned or damaged. 4 Install new airbags. To replace driver\u0027s side airbag, unscrew the screws of the steering wheel column and place somewhere safe. Pull out the old airbag until the backside with wires are visible. Unplug the old airbag from the wires. Grab the new airbag and plug it into the wires. Now put the steering column back on. To change airbag on the passenger side, remove the bolts to your glove box or dash panels. Take out the old airbag and unplug from wires. Plug in new airbag and put back into place. Put glove box or dash panels back and replace bolts. 5 Finish by hooking your car\u0027s negative cable back up and reactivating the fuses.

Essentially, it involves using electric currents to apply chrome to a part of a car. There are a number of reasons people choose to have their car chromed and plated. They may be trying to prevent corrosion or make the upkeep and cleaning of their car a little less tedious. Most people are interested in chrome plating as a means of car restoration simply because it looks good. Before starting this project, though, you need to understand how to have your car chromed and plated. Ad Steps 1 Determine which parts of your car you want chromed and plated. Parts that are frequently chromed include exterior pieces, such as bumpers, grilles, door handles, and interior engine parts. Technically, it is possible to get almost your entire vehicle chrome plated if you wish. 2 Set a budget. Chrome plating can be expensive, especially if you are getting numerous parts done at once. Your budget may mean you get fewer parts done at a time, but if you have other major financial obligations, it may be better to stretch your project out over time rather than spending a large sum of money all at once. 3 Research auto shops that specialize in chrome plating vehicles. As you are researching, take into account pricing, the reputation of each shop, the years of experience each shop has, the distance from where you live, and any customer reviews you can find attesting to other jobs the shop has done. Ask for references and check with your area Better Business Bureau before deciding on a shop. 4 Go to the chrome plating shop in person and ask some of the same questions you considered when you did your Internet research. Ask if you can take a look at some of their work in person. Ask about the process of chrome plating, any special cleaning procedures you will need to implement after getting the vehicle chrome plated, how often you might expect to have to re-chrome it, and how to prevent damage to the chrome job over time. 5 Clean your car thoroughly, paying special attention to the parts you want to have work done on. 6 Take pictures of the parts you are getting chromed for liability purposes. 7 Take your car to the shop you\u0027ve chosen to do the job. If you do not live within driving distance from the shop and the parts you want chromed are small, you could inquire as to shipping options for the parts to prevent travel.

Ask it here: Submit Warnings A lot of car buffs like to take on car restoration projects on their own at home. This is not one of those projects. Because chrome plating can be highly expensive and dangerous if you do not have formal experience working with the materials involved, you are best leaving any chrome plating of your car parts to professionals. You most likely will not be able to get a firm estimate on how much it is going to cost you to get a part chrome plated until you have taken it into a shop for professionals to look at. The websites of some chrome plating companies may say that they can give estimates based on which part you are looking to have work done on, but it often comes down to the condition the part is in. Even if you send in photographs, most professionals will not be able to give you anything close to a definite price until they have seen it themselves.

Ad Steps Part 1 Steering wheel shakes when braking 1 Notice what happens when coming to a quick stop. If the steering wheel shakes and sometimes the brake pedal may feel it moves up and down, the cause is warped front brake rotors. Brakes can overheat by driving with one foot on the brake pedal and one foot on the gas pedal. Try to drive using the right foot only. Brakes can also overheat through excessive use such as driving too fast. Staying with the traffic\u0027s normal speed will prolong the use of your vehicle. 2 Have a mechanic resurface or replace the front brake rotors. Part 2 Steering wheel shakes at certain speed 1 Notice what happens when you are driving at 55mph and your steering wheel shakes but does not shake at lower speeds. The cause is that the wheel is out of balance. A wheel weight may have come off, or excessive tire wear. 2 Have a mechanic rotate and balance all four wheels. Part 3 Steering wheel shakes all the time or pops loud . 1 Notice if when driving any speed, the steering wheels shakes and sometimes pops. The cause is a bad steering joint such as tie rod ends, ball joints or steering arms. 2 Look for tire wear and have a mechanic do a front end alignment. They will check joints and replace bad joints before alignment. Part 4 Steering wheel moves at low speed, then shakes hard at high speed 1 Drive slowly. If you notice that the vehicle seems to move up and down, and that the faster you drive the harder it bounces, then the cause is likely a knot or bubble on the tire. A bent rim can cause the same bounce. Usually this is caused by pot holes or driving off road. 2 Have a mechanic look for knots on tires. The wheel would need to be spin balanced to find bent rim. Part 5 Steering wheel shakes when accelerating or hard pull uphill 1 Notice if when driving up hill on the highway or accelerating from a stop, the steering wheel shakes. This only happens to front wheel drive cars. The ball bearings in the front axles can become oval shaped, causing the shake under a load. 2 Have a mechanic replace the front axles and inspect the front wheel bearings.

For those that suffer from allergies or find debris on their dashboard when they use the climate controls, this will surely help. Ad Steps 1 Locate and purchase the correct cabin air filter. For mine, the NAPA auto part filter number was #4816 (approx $20.50). It\u0027s a rectangular filter, not unlike the standard air filters you replace regularly. The difference is that this one is a bit thinner/smaller, and has plastic \"posts\" or \"stand offs\" molded into it. 2 Locate the passenger side cowl. In plain English, this is the plastic piece just below where your window wipers sit when they are at rest. There are two \"cowls\" One on the driver side, one on the passenger side. You will be removing the passenger side only. 3 With the hood down, stand at the front, passenger side of your car. Face your front windshield and look for a series of small, round, plastic caps just beneath where the wipers are at rest. You will remove the first four only - counting from the passenger side toward the center. 4 Use a very thin screwdriver or knife to pop the cap to reveal a Phillips head screw underneath. Remove each of the four screws with a medium sized Phillips screwdriver. 5 Open your hood. Locate the \"under hood\" portion of the cowl you are working with. Facing the engine from the front of the car, it will be all the way in the back, on the left side. 6 Locate a series of four round Phillips screws (generally black in color). They are set in what appear to be plastic washers of the same color. These plastic washers have squeezable bottoms so they are able to be popped in and out quite easily. 7 Back the Phillips screws out a few turns. This may require you to push on the bottom of the screw to make it lift. 8 Squeeze the bottom portion of the washer piece. As the bottom portion is squeezed together, you will be able to push the entire washer, and screw, up through the hole. Keep the washer/screw sets in a safe place. 9 Pull the \"cowl\" up and off of the housing. It may be a little sticky. Note: It will still be on the car. You are just moving it out of your way. 10 With the cowl up, locate a small black handle that reads \"pull\". This is a water guard that covers the cabin air filter. Pull the handle and it will give way. 11 Once the splash guard has been removed, you can install the new cabin air filter. Install it \"posts\" side up. (The plastic stand offs point upward). 12 Replace the water guard by pushing it back into place. Each of the three hooks will line up the same way they did before. 13 Replace the plastic screws/washer combinations into each of their four holes. 14 Close the hood. 15 Replace each of the four Phillips screws. 16 Replace each of the four end caps on each of the Phillips screws. 17 You\u0027re done!

Avoid jostling the heater core itself when you uninstall the instrument panel. This could cause leaks and other problems. Be sure to inspect the hoses as you\u0027re removing them. Replace them if necessary.

This is a simple enough but \"tricky\" job -- but much less expensive, if you do it yourself (a new belt costs about $20 to $50 and new tensioner with a pulley included at a retail parts store costs about $75 to $130). Parts cost about 40% to 50% less, if ordered from a real discount auto parts website on the internet (shipping takes from 2 to 6 days with extra cost for 1 day delivery, where available), compare prices and service because some are not good deals. Many vehicles (mid-1990s and up) use a tensioner pulley to tighten the one serpentine type of belts. For many V6 Chrysler-Plymouth, and certain Chrysler-Mitsubishi engines installed, in Plymouth Voyagers, if so equipped are mostly as described; yet the details/design may differ. Ad Steps 1 Prepare by: setting the parking gear/brake, and blocking rear wheels. Raise the hood, allow the engine to cool. Caution: disconnect the battery for safety, avoiding someone turning the starter by mistake. Shows tight access to belts because of hoses, tubing... pretty hard to see belts and nuts, etc. Find a diagram of the belt routing, sometimes on a sticker in the engine compartment, or you can draw one or get one in a book, because it may be tricky getting it back on, routed correctly. 2 Remove the belt, pivoting the strong tensioner, releasing tension by pulling forward on the wrench (clockwise). There is not enough space for using a regular ratchet or break-over tool with regular shallow socket. Possibly, try a box end wrench/or combination wrench, with a pipe \"cheater handle\" for more leverage. Or, ask at the parts store about the \"rental tool kit\", to get the long, thin handled tool, with a very shallow 15mm (19/32 inch) socket, or possibly using a 15mm \"crow-foot\". Caution: avoid serious finger injury from pinching between a pulley/or such and the tension belt. Let off tension carefully and gradually: the spring can throw the tool or swing it with some really quick force, if released under tension! Do not cut the belt to remove it! Sudden release is dangerous and may do damage. Consider trying a new belt, if you have not done so, before a new tensioner. The belt coming off suddenly in rain/puddles may have damaged the tensioner and/or the belt. Remove the pulley from the tensioner, removing the pulley bolt (counterclockwise); save the existing pulley, washer and bolt to reuse, in case your new tensioner comes without a pulley. Jack up your car -- carefully, with jack on a solid surface, such as concrete pad or large stepping stone; jack up the car enough to get under the car with a little wiggle room. (You may protect the under car metal where the jack is placed with a 2X4 inch or 2X6 inch, short piece of a wooden stud or joist lumber.) Preferably use steel jack stands, on a solid base; avoid the danger of using heavy concrete blocks -- and never use light, \"cinder\" building blocks, or odd-and-ends of stacked materials.

Ask it here: Submit Removing Tensioner Find the single nut reached from below the exhaust manifold in order to take it off the single-mounting-stud, that extends through the lower alternator bracket. Visibility: It is very hard to see the nut from either above or below, but it can (partially) be seen from above, located below the alternator -- or looking up through a niche in brackets from underneath the car. Use a 3?8 inch (1.0 cm) drive ratchet, 6 inches (15.2 cm) extension, and a wobble/woggle adapter or woggle extension or \"u-joint\" (universal-joint) adapter snapped onto a shallow 15 mm socket up by the engine block underneath the intake manifold/engine-head. There is a little space to get hands and forearms up in between some big struts/braces below the engine. Place the woggle with socket through a small place in the brackets right-up against the manifold. It will go almost directly through onto the single compression nut retaining the tensioner, being sure that it\u0027s the correct nut, loosen it counterclockwise. (Power ratchet: After breaking the nut loose, a power ratchet could be used with about 6 to 12 inches drive extension as with the manual ratchet. Impact wrench: with about a 36 inch extension can reach it from the other side/wheel well!) Remove the nut retaining the tensioner. Remove the tensioner. Caution: Never attempt to open the cover over the strong, compressed spring in the tensioner. The spring can fly around, damage equipment or cause severe injury. Installing Tensioner Install the new tensioner in reverse order of the removal steps. Use tape to keep the nut in the socket while getting it started. Jam the 3?8 inch (1.0 cm) drive extension up in place under the exhaust manifold, with a medium sized straight-blade screwdriver. Install the replacement pulley in the reverse order of removal. If the new tensioner does not come with a new tensioner pulley, then using the previously removed pulley hardware, Note: This pulley has a permanently lubricated, sealed bearing, but it may become dry and defective and need replacement with a good or new one. Take care to not ruin the new belt, being sure it is seated properly in the grooves of pulley. Otherwise, the belt can \"ride-out\" of the grooves (when the engine is started) and be pinched, torn, stretched/ruined, if it comes off. Follow your diagram of how the belt goes among the pulleys; extreme care should be taken to check pulleys located in \"hard to see\", remote locations for proper fit and alignment of belt in grooves. It can be tricky. Tips Booby-trap: It may seem possible to remove the alternator to get to the tensioner nut, but actually the tensioner (on certain models) must be removed first to remove a bracket that holds the alternator from falling off, if it came loose. That design is awkward, but that is the \"design\" -- like it or not. Only designated, special tool kits are for rental (buying and returning the kit for a refund), within 48 hours at one major U.S. parts store chain or up to 30 days (at another); ask for full details. Warnings Be sure that the engine is off, cool and the battery is disconnected for safety before work on the belt and tensioner. Crushing hazard: Jacks may lean, wobble and slip, fail or fall, especially if the car slides, wheels are not set, or if the car were pushed, even by hand, etc. Jack stands sink into dirt, asphalt or gravel, and can easily lean and fall.

You can spend several hundred dollars for a mechanic to install a new device, or you can take a weekend to do the work yourself. This is a relatively complex car repair, and you should not attempt it as your first automotive project. Ad Steps Part 1 Preparing Prior to Installation 1 Read your vehicle\u0027s owner\u0027s manual. Before you touch so much as a screw around the vehicle’s instrument cluster, thoroughly read the owner’s manual. You will find helpful information in the manual concerning the wiring around the dash cluster, as well as a schematic for the instrument panel that will help locating the correct hardware, wiring, components, etc. Many cars, especially those purchased used from private owners may no longer have the owner’s manual. You might be able to find a downloadable version of the manual online from the manufacturer’s website, but if not, you should be able to order one directly from the manufacturer via a certified dealership. 2 Find an appropriate speedometer. The dimensions of a speedometer vary from vehicle to vehicle and after-market products are most certainly not universal. You can consult the parts department at a certified dealer to ensure that you order a speedometer that will fit properly into your instrument panel. The gauge won’t just need to meet dimension specifications, but you also have to consider what all connects to your specific vehicle’s speedometer. Some have one wire for a dash light while some have two. Vehicles with an automatic transmission may also have a gear selection wire connected to the speedometer. Ordering a component with everything you need is essential. If you would rather not go through a dealership but you have a trusted mechanic, he or she will likely have access to the same parts information and can also ensure that you order an appropriate speedometer. 3 Gather the necessary tools. While removing and installing a speedometer doesn’t require any specialized equipment, you do need to make sure that you have both phillips and flathead screwdrivers on hand, as well as a pair of pliers, a good wrench set, and possibly a good socket wrench set. Part 2 Disconnecting the Current Speedometer 1 Disconnect your vehicle’s battery. The wiring to your current speedometer feeds from the vehicle’s battery, and you risk shocking yourself while dealing with these wires if you do not disconnect the battery first thing. 2 Loosen the screws around your vehicle’s instrument cluster. One of the schematic pages in your owner’s manual should point out the location of each screw you will need to remove. Pay close attention to which screws instead of removing every screw around the cluster since some of them may not need to be removed. Make sure you store the screws in a safe spot where you will not lose them while working on the installation. After removing the screws, the face plate around the instrument panel will still be held in place by pressure clips. Use a flathead screwdriver to pry an edge of the plate forward gently and pull lightly on the plate until all of the pressure clips release. Be very careful during this because it is possible to break the clips.[1] There will be large electrical plugs connected to buttons such as your hazard lights as well. You can hold the release to easily remove these plugs. In most model vehicles, these plugs only fit into their proper housing, so incorrectly connecting them later is impossible.[2] When in doubt, label each with a piece of tape as you disconnect it. 3 Pull the instrument cluster out of the dash. Though all of the wiring will still be connected, you will have some room to ease the instrument cluster forward from the dash.[3] 4 Locate your speedometer in the instrument cluster. The backside of your speedometer will be a rounded or squared box with several wires attached for powering the gauge itself as well as the dash lighting that illuminates the gauge when you turn on your headlights.[4] 5 Take pictures of the current configuration. When all else fails, connecting the wiring to look like the picture is better than trying to remember how the configuration looked before disconnecting the old speedometer. Between the pictures you take and the schematic in your owner’s manual, you should feel more comfortable disconnecting the old speedometer as well. 6 Disconnect the wiring from the current speedometer. Depending on your vehicle’s manufacturer, disconnecting any wiring connectors may require the use of pliers, wrenches, and/or a screwdriver. Loosen any screws or connectors until the wiring comes off easily. Don’t force it. Otherwise, you may turn the relatively easy gauge swap into a much more difficult electrical problem that requires a professional. There will likely be additional screws on the back of the instrument panel that hold the speedometer in place. You will also need to remove these screws in addition to the wiring to completely free the gauge from the panel. In some model vehicles, this wiring may all be joined into one single plug that is snapped into place in the back of the speedometer. For this setup, simply push down on the release on the plug and remove it from the speedometer.[5] Part 3 Installing the New Speedometer 1 Set the new speedometer in place on the instrument panel. Reattach it by screwing it to the mounting points that held the old speedometer in position. 2 Reconnect lighting connections for the speedometer. Reconnect the wiring as your owner\u0027s manual schematic and your reference pictures indicate. You may have to tighten down some connections as well. If the model is compatible with your car, they should connect as the old one did. If your model vehicle has a joint-wiring plug and you ordered a suitable speedometer, then the plug should snap easily into place. 3 Slide the instrument cluster back into position. You will have to replace any screws that you initially removed from the cluster as well. 4 Replace the panel face plate in front of your instrument panel. You will have to reconnect any electrical plugs that you disconnected when removing the plate as well as snap the pressure clips back in place before tightening the screws in place. Don’t tighten the screws down too hard since this piece is plastic in most vehicles and can break. 5 Reconnect your car\u0027s battery. After you reconnect it, confirm that the electrics turn on. Since you likely had to unplug a few items connected to the panel plate, check everything in the dash from your hazard lights to your turn signals and headlights. Make sure everything is in working order. 6 Check the speedometer’s calibration. By using a stopwatch and your odometer, you can test drive your car and confirm that the new speedometer is accurate. Pick a large empty parking lot or another area where you can maintain a slow consistent speed. If you go one mile (odometer) in three minutes (stopwatch) at a consistent speed, then you know you were traveling at 20mph. If your new speedometer is off, follow the manufacturer’s directions that came with your specific speedometer to calibrate it.

The only reason you would have to replace one is because someone tried to steal your ride, or you tried to install a steering wheel and busted something inside. Sometimes, wiring can catch fire or you break it trying to change the lock barrel. Most of the time, servicing this part requires a dealer or skilled mechanic. Even if you believe you need to replace this part, explore all options before replacing it as this can be a time consuming and dangerous job. You can end up breaking some very expensive and had to find parts if you do this wrong. Take your time and give yourself a day to get this done. As there are many kinds of cars, this how to is going to be generic. You will need a socket set with extensions, a universal joint, as well as screwdrivers and trim removal tools. Ad Steps 1 Disconnect the negative battery cable and wait at least 15 or 20 minutes before working on it. This is so the airbag can deactivate. If you have a radio with a theftlock system, you might want to unlock it first or you will be taking it to the dealer to fix it. 2 Remove the plastic trim from the steering column. 3 Remove the hush panels from under the dash. Some are held on with 7mm screws, push fasteners. 4 Remove the knee bolster from under the steering column. These usually pull off and are held in place with clips. Look for screws and be careful as this is plastic. 5 Remove the steel backing behind the knee bolster. These are usually held on by several bolts. 6 Make sure the front wheels are pointed straight ahead, but do not lock the ignition if it locks the steering column. Loop the seatbelt through the steering wheel instead. 7 Remove the pinch bolt from the steering coupler. This is what holds the column to the steering gear. You may have to move the steering wheel to access the bolt. Sometimes this is outside, or inside the vehicle. On many front wheel drive cars with rack and pinion steering, this means dropping the engine cradle 4 inches to access it. You may have to peel back a rubber boot to access this as well. Make a note as to how far you had to turn the wheel and return it to the original position after removing the bolt. For example, if you had to turn the wheel 1/2 turn to the right, turn it back 1/2 turn to the left. Use a piece of masking tape or use some other means to keep the wheel from turning after this is disconnected. Turning the wheel too far or losing center can destroy expensive parts. 8 Remove any cables or wires from the steering column. Cars with shifters on the column usually have a cable that runs to the transmission and that could be inside or outside the firewall. Unhook this too. 9 Most 1989 and newer cars have four 14mm nuts that hold the column to the dash. If your ride has a shifter on the column and the shift indicator is mechanical, you will need to make sure you don\u0027t break the cable as you lower the column. If you have one of these, make a mark where the clip goes and remove it before you lower the column. Many of these are parts are NLA (no longer available) from the dealer as these were only made through the late 1990s. 10 Carefully remove the column from the vehicle and set aside. 11 To install a new column, line it up inside the coupler and fasten it to the dash. The wheel on the new column needs to be pointed straight ahead. If yours had the mechanical shift indicator, install this on the new part before raising it all the way and cinching it up. 12 Install the pinch bolt so it\u0027s tight. Reinstall the boot over the coupler. 13 Reconnect any cables or wires you disconnected. 14 Reinstall the steel backing and the knee bolster. 15 Reinstall any trim and the hush panels you removed to access the steering column. 16 Reconnect the battery. 17 Make sure the steering operates correctly before taking the car out in traffic.

If installed properly, they can even pay for themselves with the boost in gas mileage. You can even do additional work to upgrade the throttle body after installing a new air intake system to see even more impressive results. Though each air intake comes with its own set of manufacturer’s instructions, there is a basic method to installing most systems. Ad Steps Part 1 Preparing to Change Air Intake Systems 1 Determine the exact specifications of your car. If you own a commonly customized car, such as a Honda Civic or a Volkswagen Jetta, you will likely need only your model, year, and engine type. If your car is less commonly modified, it may be harder to find aftermarket parts. 2 Research the types of intakes available and choose the one that fits your needs best. Short-pipe intakes are the simplest design to install, but offer the least benefits in terms of horsepower, torque, and gas mileage. They pull hot air directly from within the engine compartment into the engine. Cold air intakes pull cool air from places outside the engine compartment such as around the wheel well or bumper. These are a bit more complicated to install since you may have to install part of the intake from underneath the car. The cooler air is denser than the air inside the engine compartment so it gives a better boost to performance and gas mileage than short-pipe designs. Ram-air intakes usually pull cool air from the bumper area. Because they are designed to be at the front of the car, they actually pressurize the cool air coming into the engine as the car moves faster. This provides maximum airflow and maximum benefits. It is also the most complicated to install since you will likely have to install part of the system from underneath the car. You may even have to remove your bumper.[1] 3 Park your car. You should choose an area that has plenty of space for you to move around the front and sides of your vehicle. You also want a well-lit area so that you can see what you are doing. Be sure to turn your vehicle off before proceeding. 4 Wait until your engine has cooled completely before doing anything. Parts in the engine compartment can get very hot when the car is running.[2] You do not want to get burned. 5 Unplug the car battery. Start by removing the negative terminal (black or unmarked) and then remove the positive terminal (red). Part 2 Removing the Original Air Intake 1 Locate the air intake. This should be easy to identify. It will look like a large plastic tube running from the engine to a large plastic filter box. 2 Remove the air intake system. This consists of removing the air filter, the filter box, and the tube running from the filter box to the opening in the engine bay. Some of these parts will be attached to the engine bay by small plastic mounts. You will need a wrench or socket set to remove the small bolt holding the mounts in place. Some pieces of the intake system are fastened to each other with hose clamps, which can be loosened by turning the small bolt on the end with a screwdriver or socket. You may need to remove one or more air sensors which feed information to the car\u0027s computer. These should be handled very delicately. 3 Keep your original air intake. If the new intake you purchased is damaged or doesn’t fit, you will have to re-install the original intake system before driving your car. Set the intake aside until you know the new one works properly. Part 3 Installing the New Air Intake 1 Install the new intake. You should follow the specific manufacturer’s instructions as to which piece to install first. Be sure to secure the intake with hose clamps where appropriate. Carefully re-install any sensors removed with the old intake. Once the new intake is installed, install a new air filter.[3] Remember that if you purchased a cold air or ram air intake, you will likely need to climb under the car to complete the installation as these systems pull cool air from outside the engine compartment. 2 Check to make sure the intake system is secured properly. If the intake easily strikes other objects in the engine bay, tighten the mountings until it is secure. 3 Re-attach your battery terminals. You should attach the red (positive) terminal first. Next, attach the black (negative/ground) terminal. 4 Test drive your new intake! You want to make sure that the intake is functioning properly before you hit the open road.

Ask it here: Submit Video Tips Just like all air filters, the filters on aftermarket intakes will need to be periodically cleaned or replaced. Follow manufacturer instructions to properly care for your filter. Several quality manufacturers make products for a variety of vehicles, including Advanced Engine Management (AEM), Injen, and K\u0026N. Warnings If you install a cold air intake, your vehicle will now be getting air from outside of the engine compartment. Virtually all accomplish this by placing the filter around the front fender or bumper. This is much closer to the ground than stock intakes, and if the vehicle travels through water high enough to reach the intake, it may suck water into the engine. This causes what is called \"hydrolock\", and may damage the engine. Be careful when approaching standing water to ensure this doesn\u0027t happen. Installing a bypass valve will prevent this, but cost more money. The battery should always be disconnected before you start work. Performance air intakes are not simply large tubes. Each is carefully designed, with the diameter, bend angles, and connections experimentally determined to provide consistent, maximized airflow. Using home-made improvised intakes could negatively impact performance, and in some cases be very dangerous.

Ad Steps 1 Be sure that the engine and exhaust is cool to the touch. 2 Remove passenger side fender well to gain access to the v band clamp on the exhaust housing of the turbo, which connects to the downpipe. 3 Use a hacksaw or a sawzall to cut the downpipe before the crossmember. (This will make it much easier to get the downpipe out from under the truck.) Remove the downpipe. 4 Begin loosening clamps throughout the exhaust. Remove the hangers that are attached to the vehicle frame. Remove all factory exhaust with these instructions. 5 At the tailpipe section of the exhaust, cut off and remove the factory spare tire heat guard. This will accommodate the bigger size of the aftermarket exhaust. 6 Install the new and improved aftermarket exhaust! Starting with the downpipe, attach the aftermarket downpipe with the factory v band that was taken off earlier. 7 Add the straight pieces of exhaust pipe until you have reached where the muffler should go in place. (Most aftermarket kits come with the pieces of pipe labeled 1, 2, 3, etc.) Make sure not to tighten all clamps until entire exhaust system is in place. 8 Hang the muffler. The muffler should allow exhaust pipe to slide inside of it from either direction and, can be quite difficult at times a pair of pliers may be needed to stretch the ends of the muffler. (Hanging the muffler by yourself can be quite difficult; try finding a partner to help with this step.) 9 Hang the over the axle pipe and tailpipe section. Make sure all hangers are hung well; penetrating oil can be used to make the hangers slide through the rubber bushings easier. 10 Reinstall the passenger side fender well. 11 Crank the truck up and make sure there are no rattling sounds of loose exhaust.

Between the years of 2003 and 2007, the cars were made with the exact same compartments and interiors. For the most part, car companies change their interior designs of a car model about every 4 years. So, prior to 2003 and after 2007, you are dealing with different interiors and compartments; therefore, the instructions to installing an auxiliary will be different to these instructions. This is an instruction set for installing an auxiliary system in a 2003-2007 Honda Accord. After gathering the required tools and items, you will remove the compartments under the stereo. Once all compartments are removed, the internal wiring will be revealed so you can attach the auxiliary underneath the stereo. Ad Steps 1 Get everything ready. Make sure the vehicle is off and parked with the emergency brake up and in use. Gather all the items and tools you will need. Refer to the Things You\u0027ll Need section at the end of article. 2 Move the shift knob back all the way. Use the flat-blade screwdriver to remove the small plastic cap piece next to the shift knob. Then, use the flat-blade screwdriver to press down and hold the inside of the uncapped piece and pull the shift knob back all the way. 3 Remove the plastic cover surrounding the shift knob. The cover is attached tightly in 6 locations. There are 2 in the back corners, 2 on the sides, and 2 in the front corners by the park \"P\" symbol. Remove it by lodging the flat-blade screwdriver between the plastic cover and rectangular area and pulling up to pop the cover out of place. The cover is easiest to remove by popping out the front corners located by the park \"P\" symbol and one of the sides. Once at least 3 locations are out of place, the cover can be removed by just pulling it with some force. 4 Remove the 2 corner screws located near the rectangular area of the shift knob. Unscrew the 2 screws by the front corners using the phillips screwdriver and use the long-nose pliers to remove the screws without them falling into the wiring section. If the screws do fall into the wiring section, refer to Tips at the end of the article. 5 Open the left compartment and remove the rubber tray. Do this using the flat-blade screwdriver and lodging it in the seam until it is well underneath the tray and pushing the tray out from underneath as shown in the image below. 6 Remove the next set of 2 screws and remove the compartment. Find the 2 screws in the back that need to be removed which are circled in the image above. Use the phillips screwdriver and the long-nose pliers to remove the 2 screws. Then, use your hand to grip the 2 sectioned compartment and pull to pop it out of place. 7 Remove the power outlet wire and remove the last set of 2 corner screws. Remove the wire connected to the power outlet by pressing down on the button on the back of the wire and pulling. Now, the 2 sectioned compartment can be set aside in order to remove the next compartment, which is the largest one. Next, remove the 2 screws at the bottom corners of the large compartment which are circled in the image above. Use the phillips screwdriver and the long-nose pliers to remove the screws. 8 Remove the largest compartment. In order to remove the large compartment, press down and hold at the bottom of the large compartment door in order to reveal the seam between the top of the compartment and the bottom of the stereo. Lodge the flat-blade screwdriver in the seam and push the screwdriver away from you while using your other hand and gripping the bottom of the compartment and popping it out of place. The compartment has to pop out of place towards you; therefore, you should pull with your hand from underneath and push away with the screwdriver in order to have this affect. Once the compartment is out of place, pull it out of the area by making sure the compartment door is closed and the bottom of the compartment is removed first. After the compartment is removed, you have access to the wiring of the stereo. 9 Attach the auxiliary system. Attach the auxiliary box to the side of the centered compartments by the passenger seat using Command adhesive products. Also, place the auxiliary box someplace low and a little towards the back in order for the wire to have enough length to reach the wiring section underneath the stereo. 10 Pass the auxiliary wire behind the glove compartment and into the wiring section. Open and empty out the glove compartment. Then, push in the flexible sides of the open glove compartment so that it slides off the corner hooks holding it open. Once doing so, the glove compartment will be open all the way and touch the mats. This will allow you to have access behind the glove compartment in order to pass the wire behind the glove compartment and through the hole shown in the image below. 11 Connect the wire to the white piece underneath the stereo. Grab the wire passed through the hole and pull it through until you can see it in the wiring section underneath the stereo. Then, connect the wire to its extension which is one of the adjacent ends of the Y cable of colorful wires. Next, attach the opposing end of the Y cable, not the adjacent end, to the white piece underneath the stereo that can be seen if you peek into the wiring section and look up. Use scissors and electrical tape to tape the wires of the Y cable to the wall in order to prevent the compartments to interfere with them as shown in the image below. 12 Check to see if the auxiliary works. After the connection is made, turn the car radio on and press the Aux button on the stereo. The CD-C display should appear. 13 Put everything back in order using the following steps. First, close the glove compartment. Then, put back the largest compartment and screw it in. Place the largest compartment into place by pushing it until it clicks into place. If it is fitting correctly it should not move and the compartment door should be working perfectly. Screw in the 2 screws that were removed in step 7 which are at the bottom corners of the large compartment. Next, put the 2 sectioned compartment back into place and screw it in. Reattach the wire from step 7 to the power outlet in the 2 section compartment and push that down into place. Screw in the 2 screws from step 6 which are in the back of the 2 sectioned compartment. Place the rubber tray back into place by just pushing it down. Screw in the final 2 screws and place the plastic cover. Screw in the final 2 screws from step 4 which are the corners of where the park \"P\" symbol is. Place the plastic cover into place surrounding the shift knob. Finally, put the shift knob back into park \"P\" and cap the small piece next to park \"P\". No screwdriver is required for this, since the shift knob is already not in park. You will be able to do this by just pressing the button on the shift knob and moving it. Then, cap the small piece next the park \"P\" symbol and turn the car off. You\u0027re done! Now you can enjoy music from your hand held device in your 2003-2007 Honda Accord. Reader Questions and Answers Unanswered Questions Show more unanswered questions Add New Question Answered Questions Don\u0027t see your question? Ask it here: Submit Tips Almost all of these steps should be done with little but not too much strength. It is important to have the pliers in order to pull out the screws because hands can be clumsy in tight spaces. Also, if the screws fall into the wiring section, the pliers can reach where hands can\u0027t. It is preferred to have screwdrivers with magnetic tips to help prevent screws from falling. These will also help retrieve the screws because they are magnetic. Place all small items in a safe place where they will not get lost, such as your cup holders. If you connect the auxiliary and the stereo does not read it, unplug it and try again. If it still does not work, return the item. If the connection between the stereo and the auxiliary is lost while putting everything back or after you are finished, retake everything apart in order to unplug it and plug it back in for a more stable and secure connection. This should not happen if you use the electrical tape around the Y cable to keep it compact and away from the interference of compartments. Warnings There is no electrical danger in this entire step by step process. Things You\u0027ll Need An auxiliary system compatible with a 2003-2007 Honda Accord stereo system, like the one below. The system should contain the auxiliary box with the wires at one end and the cord at the other end, the Y extension cable, and a male to female auxiliary extension cord. A phillips screwdriver, flat-blade screwdriver, long-nose pliers, scissors, and electrical tape. A set of Command adhesive strips.","sourceUrl":"cars\\How to Install an Aux in a 2003?2007 Honda Accord.html"},{"id":127,"title":"How to Install Starter Relay for Heatsoak Problems on an Aircooled Volkswagen (VW) Beetle","body":"Edit Article How to Install Starter Relay for Heatsoak Problems on an Aircooled Volkswagen (VW) Beetle Questions and Answers Is your air cooled VW difficult to start?

Unless you have access to a full-size hydraulic lift like you might find at a mechanic\u0027s, this will mean using a jack. Jacks are generally easy to use, but care must be taken to ensure your safety, especially if you\u0027re working under the car. Luckily, this just means following a few common sense rules. Ad Steps Part 1 Taking Safety Precautions If you can\u0027t meet these safety conditions or if you are unsure of how to proceed given your conditions, call for help. 1 Park the car on a hard, flat surface. Having the car slip or roll off of the jack can be extremely dangerous to yourself and others. To prevent this, always work on a flat surface away from moving vehicles or distractions. The surface you work on should be hard and sturdy so that it will not shift or give way while you are working. A concrete driveway or garage away from the road are good examples. A yard is a bad choice — even if it\u0027s flat, the dirt may not be strong enough to support the car. 2 Chock the wheels. Chocks are wedge-shaped blocks made from metal and rubber that keep the wheels from rolling. Set a chock in front of each wheel at the opposite end of the car from where you intend to lift.\" If you don\u0027t have chocks, some sources recommend bricks, cinder blocks, large rocks, or wedge-shaped pieces of wood.[1] 3 Double check that the car is parked. Set the park brake and ensure the transmission is in \"P.\" If the car has a manual transmission, put it in the lowest forward gear. 4 In sub-par conditions, take extra precautions. As noted above, the instructions in this section are intended to protect yourself and others in the event the car slips off its jack. If you can\u0027t meet the conditions above but you absolutely must jack up the car, use the instructions below to make the process safer: If you must jack the car on a soft or broken surface such as a dirt shoulder, use a thick, flat piece of wood to make a stable platform for the jack. If you must jack the car on a slight incline, park next to the curb and turn the wheels in to the curb so that they are touching it. This will prevent an out-of-control car from hurting others if it slips off the jack. Similarly, if you don\u0027t have anything to block the wheels with, turn the tires into the curb.[2] Never jack the car on the shoulder of a roadway. If you must jack the car somewhere near traffic, put on your hazard lights. If you have flares, cones, or pylons, use these to direct traffic away from you. Part 2 Raising the Car 1 Find the jack point. Most vehicles have several points along the body where the vehicle is designed to be lifted. If you lift somewhere else, the car\u0027s own weight may cause damage to the frame (or, worse — cause it to slip off the jack). Luckily, the owner\u0027s manual will almost always tell you where a car\u0027s jack points are. Typically, there is a jack point on each side behind the front wheels and in front of the back wheels. This will often be next to the rocker panels (the metal or plastic strips beneath the doors). Sometimes, there are two more central jack points located just behind the front and rear bumpers. If you\u0027re not sure where the jack points are, look for a flat metal area along the pinch weld (the weld running down the side of the car beneath the doors). There may also be a notch that matches the shape of the top of the jack, a cutout in the plastic skirt that exposes metal, or a sturdy plastic block attached to the frame. There may even be a spot labeled \"jack\" on the undercarriage. 2 Position the jack under the jack point. Slide your jack underneath the jack point you just found. It doesn\u0027t need to be lined up perfectly — you will be able to slide it around until it is touching the car. Make sure the correct side is facing up. If the jack itself isn\u0027t labeled with a \"this side up\" warning, look in your owner\u0027s manual for visual instructions. Typically, the jack will have a wide, flat base and a smaller upward-facing arm with \"teeth\" at the edges pointing up into the body of the car. 3 Raise the jack. The precise way to do this will depend on which type of jack you have (see below). As the upper arm of the jack nears the underside of the car, make last-minute adjustments as needed so that it lines up with the jack point. Scissor Jacks: These jacks look like two horizontal metal plates with a diamond-shaped mechanism in between. On one side of the jack is a metal hole connected to the main screw drive. Slip the included rod tool through the hole and turn to pull the sides of the jack inward and push the top and bottom of the jack apart. This lifts the vehicle. Hydraulic Jacks: Also called bottle or floor jacks. These look like metal base sections with a lever-like base extending to one side. There is a slot to slip the included rod tool into on one side. Crank the rod up and down in long, steady strokes to pump hydraulic fluid into the cylinder and raise the jack. 4 Lift the car off of the ground. When the jack makes contact with the underside of the car, it will become harder to raise. Keep working the jack upward until you notice the corner of the car leave the ground. You can stop when the car has enough clearance for you to do your work. For common tasks like changing a tire, just a few inches is all that\u0027s necessary. Pay careful attention to any sound or movement while lifting the car. It is common to hear a \u0027pop\u0027 or a \u0027thud\u0027 as the jack shifts slightly. If this happens, check that it hasn\u0027t slipped out of position before continuing. Keep all parts of your body out from under the car at all times while lifting it. Though unlikely, serious injury or death can result if the car slips off the jack past this point. 5 If you will be working under the car, use jack stands. Work that requires you to put any part of your body under the car calls for jack stands. These offer a wider, more secure base for the car\u0027s weight than ordinary jacks. It is unsafe to work under the car without jack stands. See our jack stands article for detailed instructions. Typical use is as follows:[3] Slip two jack stands underneath the car near where the jack is supporting it. Line the stands up with the pinch weld or jack point. Raise the jack stands until they are nearly touching the underside of the car. Lower the jack slowly and carefully until the jack stands \"catch\" the car. If you are not working under the car (for instance, if you are changing a tire), you can proceed without jack stands. Take care not to put any part of your body underneath the car as you work. 6 Lower the car back down when finished. At this point, you are ready to do whatever work you need to do on your car. When you are done, gradually lower the car back to the ground, remove the jack, and put it away. If you are using jack stands, you must first raise the car off of the stands, then remove the stands, and finally lower the car. See below: Scissor Jacks: Slip the rod into the screw drive hole and turn in the opposite direction as you did to raise the car. Hydraulic Jacks: Open the relief valve to let fluid drain from the hydraulic cylinder, which lowers the arm. The valve is usually a small screw keyed to the lever. Take care to open the valve slowly to avoid suddenly dropping the car.

Ask it here: Submit Tips Remember, a jack should be used to help lift a car — not to hold it in place while you work underneath. If any part of your body will be underneath the car, jack stands are a must. If you\u0027re changing a tire, unscrew the lug nuts slightly before you raise the car. If you don\u0027t, the wheel can turn when you try to unscrew them, making the task much more difficult. To test your jack or jack stands for sturdiness, before you get under the car or remove any wheels, use your body weight to wiggle the car slightly while it is raised. It is better for the car to slip off its supports before you start than after. Try keeping your jack and wheel chocks in the trunk so that you will always have them when you need them.

As it gets older, you may start noticing your car runs differently, and it\u0027s probably because of the engine. Ad Steps 1 Make sure the gas tank is at least half full to prevent dirt from going into the intake as much as possible. 2 Make sure the engine is getting plenty of air (do not add a turbo unless you know what to do), there is no air filter on small engines (lawn mowers, trimmers, etc) is technically fine, there is high flow are filter on bigger engines (vehicles, motorcycles) is best. 3 Check the oil. Oil is a must to keep full, even dirty oil is better than low oil, so if you can not purchase oil and have some old use it, do not run an engine low on oil, if oil is too low its best to wait until oil can be purchased and then use the tool. 4 Replace the spark plugs. Spark plugs should be properly gapped and kept clean as possible. Spark plugs kept clean help with start up and continuous running with best gas usage possible. Dirty plugs will use more gas plus can be hard to start. 5 Overworking the engine is never recommended. Use all engines as they are intended. The harder the engine is worked, it\u0027s more likely a new one will be needed. 6 Don\u0027t overwork your engine. If the engine seems to be running hot, stop using unless it is an absolute must. Check coolant and fan to see if things are full and running proper. If so, wait till day temperature cools a bit then start engine again.

You can end up with a door that refuses to open, a lock that refuses to budge, or both at the same time. But this is not an impossible task. With some preparation, a little know-how, and ingenuity, you will be in your vehicle soon. Ad Steps Method 1 Keeping Doors from Freezing Shut 1 Avoid weather effects. The typical cause of car doors and car locks freezing shut is ice. When icing conditions are predicted — rain near the freezing point, freezing rain, freezing fog, or rain and snow — get your vehicle under cover. Another possible cause is frigid weather, which may cause locks and car doors to freeze without a lot of moisture causing the problem. Of course, not everyone has access to a covered parking space, heated garage, or the like. Avoid locking your doors. If possible, keep doors unlocked. This will avoid the locking mechanism from locking into place. However, leaving the doors unlocked may allow the car to be entered by a thief. Do not leave any valuables in the vehicle if you plan on leaving it unlocked. Place duct tape over your door lock to keep it from freezing. If your car is parked outside, a car cover or tarp minimizes the amount of moisture from snow and rain that can reach the door parts and freeze.This is especially useful during an ice storm or other icing event. 2 Replace torn or missing rubber gaskets. The rubber gasket, or seal, along the edge of the car door is the area that freezes, not the metal itself. Inspect the seal on each car door and around each window. Visit an auto parts store to purchase replacements if you notice tears or gaps where water could seep in. 3 Wipe down the door frame. Clean the entire door frame to remove road debris and other detritus that can build up over time. Water can collect around the dirt and freeze the door shut once the temperatures drop. 4 Coat the rubber with a protective liquid. Rub oil or lubricant over the rubber seals with a paper towel. This will repel water, reducing the amount that enters the seal and freezes. There is some disagreement over which oil is best to use, but here are a few options: A rubber conditioner or rubber care product are probably the safest options for long-term care. Silicone spray lubricant can last several weeks per application, but it can damage foam rubber seals and should be kept away from paint.[1][2] WD40, another light lubricating oil, or even nonstick cooking spray are easily available options, but repeated use can dry out or disintegrate the rubber.[3] Method 2 Preventing and Dealing with Frozen Locks 1 Rub the key and lock with rubbing alcohol. Choose a rubbing alcohol that contains at least 60% alcohol, so the alcohol will adhere to the lock and prevent moisture from freezing over it. Rub it onto the key and the door lock with a paper towel once per week to prevent ice from forming. This can also work to melt existing ice, but is typically slower than the methods below.[4] Petroleum jelly is another option, but may leave a messy residue on your equipment. 2 Spray a lock lubricant for severe problems. If rubbing alcohol is not enough to keep your lock usable, select a lock lubricant. Even experts tend to have differing opinions about lubricant choices, but some options are recommended more often than others. Use only one of the following options per lock, since a mix could easily gum it up:[5][6][7] A graphite lubricant typically comes in a squeeze bottle of air that can be pressed directly into the keyhole. Some people find this can absorb moisture over time and leave gunk on the key. Teflon-based lubricant is often recommended, but some people consider the products that contain silicone messy and ineffective. Greaseless lubricants are supposed to attract less dust and debris. 3 Spray frozen locks with a de-icer. Keep a de-icer product in your garage or winter jacket, in case you are frozen out of your car. These are typically sprayed directly onto the lock, and are the most effective option in severe ice conditions. Choose the lock with the least amount of ice buildup, spray, and insert the key.[8] 4 Heat the key. Hold the key with an oven mitt or tongs, with the toothed tip over a lighter or match, then insert it in the lock. If the key is completely metal, with no plastic handle or computerized fob, you can safely heat the key while it is inserted in the lock.[9][10] This is not common a practice in cold climates; and there are other, safer alternatives for you and your vehicle. This should only be attempted if no other alternatives are available. Do not do this with a key with a computerized chip. This may easily damage the electronics, and replacements can costs hundreds of dollars. 5 Warm the lock with a hairdryer or your own breath. This method is less effective, but worth a try if no other options are available. A cardboard tube (such as an empty toilet paper tube) placed over the frozen lock will help direct the warm air.[11] Keep trying for several minutes, especially if you do not have a tube or if conditions are windy. If your car is outside, use a battery-operated hair dryer, or an extension cord rated for outdoor use.

If your car has keyless entry, it won\u0027t matter if the door lock freezes. While this won\u0027t stop car doors from freezing, a remote keyless car starter will heat the interior of the car and melt any ice that has formed in the doors. Use only lubricants that are safe for rubber seals and the paint. Warnings Avoid getting oil or lubricant on your clothing when you get in and out of the car. Use an ordinary laundry cycle with detergent to remove it.

Ad Steps 1 Chock (block) the wheels opposite of the end you are jacking. If jacking the rear, chock the wheels with wheel chocks that are available from auto parts stores. Chock the wheels on both ends (front and behind) so you need four chocks for two wheels. You can also make ramps from wood but make sure you follow a diagram or expert instruction in making your own. 2 If the car is a manual, put it in First; if the car is automatic, put it in Park. Set the parking brake. Be aware, however, the parking brake is ineffectual in holding the vehicle if you lift the rear wheels. Make sure the wheels are chocked in all scenarios. 3 Find the appropriate jack point. Jack points are often mentioned in the car manual or you can look online to find where front and rear jack points are for your car. Be careful to not place the jack on non-frame supported components like the suspension or the panel under your car\u0027s interior floor.

Maintaining your vehicle at 100,000 miles (160,000 km) and beyond is easy if you perform periodic maintenance. General tune-ups are relatively inexpensive and can protect the investment you\u0027ve made into your vehicle. Ad Steps 1 Read the owner\u0027s manual and take its recommendations to heart. Take a more conservative approach to the car\u0027s maintenance schedule if your car is over 100,000 miles (160,000 km). 2 Take a look under the hood yourself. Locate the coolant tank. If the coolant level is too high, visit a service technician. If it\u0027s too low, add coolant when the engine is cool. You\u0027ll also want to check the coolant\u0027s color. It should be either a bright orange or green, depending on the brand. If it looks more like rust, have that looked at as well. Check the oil to make sure it\u0027s never too low. 3 Adhere to a service schedule. Examine tire pressure and check that your lights are working correctly every month. You should check tire pressure with a quality pressure gauge, particularly before you go on a long trip. Change the oil every 3,000 to 4,000 miles (4,800 to 6,400 km), or even every three to four months. Use a high-mileage oil, which will help an aging engine. While getting the oil changed, ask the technician to inspect belts and hoses. It\u0027s important to be current with belt maintenance as they do not give notice before they fail and possibly destroy your engine. Hoses should be carefully inspected for any breaks or wear and replaced immediately when a problem is detected. If you haven\u0027t already done so, replace the engine timing belt. You should do this every 60,000 and 100,000 miles (97,000 and 161,000 km) or between five and eight years. Every other oil change, or every 6,000 miles (9,700 km), have the tires rotated, the wheels balanced and the brakes examined. Make sure the car\u0027s wheel bearings are checked regularly and replaced as they wear. Replace both fuel and air filters if you have not already done so. You should do this between 24,000 and 100,000 miles (39,000 and 161,000 km). Have your vehicle\u0027s cooling system flushed and refilled, maintenance that should occur between 40,000 and 100,000 miles (64,000 and 161,000 km). Some professionals say that coolant should be changed every two years because the coolant loses its effectiveness over time. Have your mechanic check the car\u0027s engine compression routinely. A compression check can indicate problems with piston rings or valves. If the engine\u0027s compression is too high, it can result in engine damage. Run a heater and air conditioner check annually. Test your battery quarterly, as a wearing battery can cause other damage--to the alternator or starter--and result in extensive repairs. Replace your battery every five or six years and keep an eye on it when the warranty period ends. 4 Keep an ear out for troubling noises. Most of the time, you\u0027ll be able to hear when your car isn\u0027t running well. Be in tune with your car\u0027s normal sounds and alert a mechanic to anything out of the ordinary.

With some extra time and effort, you can maintain a car after the odometer surpasses 50,000 miles (80,000 km) and help it run smoothly for thousands more miles to come. In addition to following these general guidelines, you should also check your car\u0027s owner manual and follow your car manufacturer\u0027s specific recommendations. Ad Steps 1 Rotate and balance your tires every 5,000 miles (8,000 km). The best or youngest tires should go on the front of your vehicle. When rotating tires from the back to the front, its important to keep tires on the same side of the car. 2 Inspect tires for uneven wear and check the tire pressure every few months. Always have your car professionally aligned when you change your tires. 3 Replace your car\u0027s air filter every 15,000 miles (24,000 km). 4 Check battery cables and terminals and clean them with a wire brush every few months to avoid corrosion build-up. Before working with a battery, remove any metal objects, such as a ring or watch, which can cause a spark. 5 Ask a mechanic to check your battery load when you have your oil changed. The battery load is how much electricity the battery can store without having to be recharged. This is particularly important if your battery is more than 2 years old. 6 Check brake fluid occasionally and fill it as needed. Use the fluid brand recommended by your owner\u0027s manual. If you need to fill more than 2 ounces of brake fluid, consider getting the brakes inspected for leaks and wear by a mechanic. You may need a complete flush and re-fill. If you do need a flush and re-fill, have the mechanic check your vehicle\u0027s brake pads and brake shoes, as well. 7 Squeeze along radiator hose to check for leaks, bulges and cracks. If you find any, replace all of the hoses at once. 8 Check your car\u0027s power steering fluid level and fill it as needed. If you need more than 2 ounces, take it to a mechanic to be checked for leaks. Have the mechanic flush out the old power steering fluid and replace it. 9 Inspect your windshield wiper blades and check washer fluid levels every 3,000 to 4,000 miles (4,800 to 6,400 km). Since should get an oil and oil filter change every 3,000 to 4,000 miles (4,800 to 6,400 km), as well, you can check your wipers at the same time.

You may want to check your lights at every oil change. 11 Test your vehicle\u0027s refrigerant levels (also known as freon) once a year. Low freon can decrease your car\u0027s performance and cause damage to its air compressors. Only a trained professional can add freon to your vehicle since it is a high-pressured gas. 12 Replace your car\u0027s transmission fluid as recommended in the owner\u0027s manual. Your manual should also tell you what type of transmission fluid and filter to use. Some vehicle models may require a special additive, as well. 13 Wash your car regularly to remove build-up on the exterior. Use soap designated for cars. Do not use dish or other household soaps, as these can deteriorate your vehicle\u0027s paint. Wax your car every other year.

The modern car may have as many as 75,000 parts, and the malfunction of just one can make your car behave very strangely. Maintaining a car in good condition will help you to keep it safe, drive it for a long time, and someday sell it for a good price. Ad Steps 1 Establish a simple plan of attack. One way to think of this is to use the acronym T.O.W.B.I.F., which stands for Tires, Oil, Windows, Brakes, Interiors, and Fluids. Use your owner\u0027s manual to establish a schedule for your car. 2 Tires. Make sure they are properly inflated to the manufacturer\u0027s specified pressure. Tire gauges are cheap and easy to use. Tires should be replaced when tread wear indicators are showing between the treads. Ask your local tire dealer if you are unsure how to identify tread wear indicators. Check your tires every other day for pressure and every week for wear or damage. Have them replaced when they become worn beyond acceptable limits. 3 Oil. Oil is the blood of your car, and without it, the car isn\u0027t going to go far or quietly. Have your mechanic demonstrate how to check your oil properly, and have the oil changed every 3,000 – 3,500 miles. While oil manufacturers have claimed that their oil can last 10,000 miles, it is generally best to use the same oil for no more than 5,000 miles to maximize engine reliability and efficiency over the long term. Check the oil regularly, about once a week, and change the oil or have it changed when you reach the 4,000–4,500 mile (6,400–7,200 km) limit. 4 Windows. Make sure that all windows, mirrors and lights are clean and not broken. Replace any broken lights or mirrors as soon as possible. Have small windshield cracks by a windshield repair center to determine whether the windshield can be repaired or needs to be replaced. Check regularly for cracks and damage. Allow plenty of room if when following behind other vehicles that could throw objects from the road or loose debris from their loads. Even a small pebble from the back of a gravel truck can damage your windshield. 5 Brakes, belts, and battery. The braking systems of modern cars are designed to be replaced periodically to maintain maximum braking efficiency. If you notice ANY problems with the brakes, take your car to have the brakes checked immediately. If the brakes fail, you can have a very serious crash. Check the belts or have them checked regularly for wear and tension. Very loose belts often make a loud squealing sound; have yours serviced if you hear this noise. Check the battery once per month for corrosion and clean it or have it cleaned and as needed. Avoid running your battery down, if possible. Even with a jump start, it\u0027s hard on the battery. Batteries do eventually get old. If you must replace your battery, also check the alternator to make sure that it is still functioning properly. 6 Interior. Clean and vacuum the interior as needed. The interior is often a point of selling power when it comes time to trade the car in or sell it. While many may not care about the oil or tires, if the CD player won\u0027t work, or the interior looks a little dirty, the deal is off. It\u0027s been said that the value of the car is held in the cabin, and that statement holds true. If you ever want to trade the car in or sell it, every quarter spent at a pay vacuum will be paid back to you with interest! 7 Fluids. The other lifeblood of the car are the fluids that the drive train must have. Coolant, power steering fluid, transmission fluid, windshield washer fluid, brake fluid, and other fluids need to be checked at a minimum of once per week. Ask your mechanic to demonstrate the method to check these. 8 Lights. You can check your own lights if you have someplace you can park near reflective glass windows, or you can ask a friend to walk around your car while you turn on different lights. Make sure to check your headlights, taillights, reverse lights, brake lights, and turn signals. Notice where your headlights point and correct it or have it corrected as needed. They should be pointing down and towards the outside of the road, not straight out, up, or towards the center. You can see the light pattern on the road ahead of you. Misaligned headlights can be distracting or hazardous to drivers ahead of you or in oncoming or adjacent lanes. If they are too low, this could limit the distance you can see while driving at night. 9 Windshield wipers. It\u0027s not difficult to replace worn wiper blades yourself. Replace just the blades once a year as needed before the rainy season. You can also replace the entire wiper assembly if needed. If you do a lot of driving in wet weather conditions, you may also want to apply a water repellent treatment to your windshield. 10 Emission control systems. Depending on where you live, you may be required to get your car checked for emissions periodically. Generally, a professional must perform the diagnosis. Oxygen sensors and EGR valves are two common culprits [1][2].

Track your mileage and fuel economy. Not only will you learn to save fuel and drive more moderately, but you will notice if something changes about your fuel efficiency. A drop in miles per gallon can signal a maintenance problem. Track your oil changes in your mileage log, too. Read your owner\u0027s manual. It has lots of information specific to your car. Follow all your car manufacturer’s recommended service intervals at a minimum. If anything seems strange or off, have it checked as soon as possible. An unusual smell, a new noise, a vibration, a new light on the instrument panel coming on, anything, have it checked! As a driver, your responsibility is to maintain your car to be as safe as possible, for your sake, and the sake of those with whom you share the road. Stay in touch with your mechanic and ask questions! Mechanics are used to people asking car questions, and most handle the questions admirably. If a mechanic isn\u0027t in the mood to give you two minutes to answer a question, ask whether he would take the time to maintain the machine you will drive down the freeway at 65 mph (105 km/h). Warnings Do not over-inflate the tires . Use only manufacturer’s approved fluids. Follow all safety precautions when checking fluids. Never open a hot cooling system.

If you\u0027re new to the old VWs this is good overview of basic things you really should do if you want to keep your VW going. Ad Steps 1 Remove large chunks of dirt and dry mud from underside of car body and chassis and check for rust. Fix rusted area and coat with top grade primer or lead-based primer and paint, or coat with fiberglass resin. Mud is usually trapped under the fender wells on the upper light domes, fender ends, and on the Super Beetle, the top area of the front coil shock springs. 2 Pull tar-paper rug off floor to expose the sheet metal floor pan. Clean and coat rusted area of floor pan with top grade primer or lead-base paint. This is very important especially the rear floors and battery area. Replace tar paper rug with rubber mats (spike side of mat down.) Note: 72 VW Beetles and later models had no tar paper rugs. 3 On VW Beetle, remove running boards (both L and R side) and clean/repair body attachment area and running boards. Coat body attachment area and metal part of running boards with fiberglass resin, and use a thin layer of fiberglass with resin at rust damaged areas. File and sand smooth all resin/fiberglass work. 4 Change fuel hose just under fuel tank, and forward of engine firewall, and at fuel pump area. Use new original VW hoses or 3/16 diameter braided fuel hoses for replacement. 5 Check fuel tank at lower area for fuel leaks. 6 Change transmission oil, and change engine oil. 7 Adjust engine valves, points, and timing. 8 Grease front wheel bearings, and grease front chassis. 9 Remove front wheel bearings, and grease front chassis. 10 Remove dirt from all four c v joints (constant velocity joints) at rear wheels (on \u002768 automatic and \u002769 and later VWs.) Disassemble and pack all four c v joints with molybdenum disulphide lithium grease. Rotate the c v joints by installing the previous wheel c v joint to the inside transmission flanges, and installing the previous transmission c v joints to the outside wheel flanges. 11 Check brake line at foot pedal area for rust and fluid leaks. Coat brake line in this area with Rustoleum or lead-base primer and paint. 12 Jack front of car to free front wheel rotation. Apply the brakes and have an assistant outside try to rotate the front left and right wheels. If one (or both) front wheel still rotates when the brakes are applied, check for faulty brake hose, brake cylinder or caliper, master cylinder, rubber grommet on Master cylinder where brake fluid enters for cracking or leakage, or brake shoes and linings. Apply (with force) and release brake and then check again for free rotation of front wheels. If one (or both) front wheels do not rotate freely, check for faulty brake hose, brake cylinder of caliper. NOTE: brake hose deteriorates from the inside and may look perfectly good on the outside. 13 Repeat above brake procedure to rear wheels. 14 Checking the brakes in this manner is the most important thing to do before driving the car. It assures the engine is not overstressed (lugged down,) and will not overheat due to faulty brakes. The engine will last longer and the car will get better gas mileage. 15 A driver can not always detect when the car brakes are dragging. Therefore, the brake procedure should also be performed when: the gas mileage drops; the car does not roll freely (coast) on the road, especially after releasing brakes; a wheel drum overheats, or smelling of burning brake shoes.

With just a few tips, any driver can preserve the lifespan of their automobile, and look good while doing so. Ad Steps 1 Know why value is important. Like you would with any investment, you want to maintain the value of your car. Buying new isn’t always the most valuable investment in a car. Keeping a car you own in top shape or buying a well-preserved used car is more cost efficient. 2 Pay attention to mileage. If you can avoid it, lessen your driving to diminish any extra miles on your car. You can opt for a rental car on road trips, which will probably be less money than the charges you’ll incur as the mileage of your car depreciates its re-sale value. If you have a long commute, see if there is somebody you work with that would be willing to carpool. The two of you can switch off driving on different days, and both of you will benefit. 3 Keep your vehicle serviced. Maintenance should be regularly checked. Not only does routine car care help you avoid unnecessary, last-minute repairs, it demonstrates to any future prospectors that you appreciated your car by properly maintaining it. Many used car shoppers are willing to spend a little bit more on a used car if it has been routinely serviced. 4 Treat your car with respect, no matter if it was bought used or new. If possible, avoid extreme driving, harsh stopping and starting, over-towing, speeding or driving in poor road conditions. 5 Avoid heavy construction areas. Construction can be the most catastrophic enemy to your vehicle. Loose gravel and flying chunks of asphalt will impair the outside of your automobile, just like rust will deteriorate the underbelly. Keeping your car cleaned and detailed, using wax to protect paint surface from elements, and vacuuming the inside frequently will help you maintain the value of your used car. 6 Beware of harsh weather. Areas with cold weather are notorious for ripping up the value of vehicles. Not only are the winter months long, but they produce harsh weather climates that involve ice, snow and salt — all of which damage cars.

Let\u0027s do it! Ad Steps 1 The easiest upgrade is intake. In order to install a cold air intake on the Focus, the battery must be removed to run the pipe underneath. Begin by taking the cables off the battery and lift it from the battery box. Then unscrew the 3 bolts holding the box in, and remove it from the car, unclipping the cables from the back and side. This will give access to the snorkel pipe. Unscrew the snorkel from the plastic piece above the grill. Loosen the clamp on the intake pipe over the throttle body. The intake filter box will just pop out, so pull up hard. Then remove the snorkel. Remove the MAF sensor via 2 torx screws. Fit all parts of the cold air intake together to make sure they will work. Fit the MAF sensor into the new intake pipe. Fit the throttle body elbow and clamp over the throttle body but do not tighten. Fit the second pipe without the filter on it yet to the first pipe via straight elbow piece, and attach PVC hose from this pipe to the fitting on the valve cover. This piece is critical if you value a long life for your motor. Crawl under the car and attach and secure tightly the intake filter. Go back and tighten all clamps. Reinstall the battery and you\u0027re finished. 2 Another simple mod on the Focus is exhaust. I recommend buying your own muffler and take it to a shop and have them install it with piping. Buying your own muffler will save you 200-300 dollars as shops overcharge for parts. 3 A good moderately difficult install is lowering springs. A good rule to remember here is you get what you pay for. Always buy name brand and not cheap eBay junk; however not all eBay items are junk. Just use common sense. If a part is 90% cheaper than the normal part, its probably a badly designed knock-off. Remember to do only one side at a time, so if you forget how something went, you can refer to the other side that\u0027s still intact. For the front springs, remove the wheels and set the car on jack stands. Remove the brake line from the strut and unscrew the tie rod end link from the bracket. Unscrew the bolt that keeps the strut in tight on the rear of the knuckle. Take your foot and push down on the brake disc until the damper pops out of the knuckle. Unscrew the 3 bolts on top of the strut tower. The whole strut assembly should fall out for you. Compress the spring with an appropriate spring compressor, using EXTREME caution. Unscrew the bolt on top, removing the top assembly. Remove the spring. Compress the new spring and put it on the damper and make sure the slots are lined up. This is VERY important! Then put the strut back together and uncompress the spring. Installation is reverse of removal. Do the same for the other side. The rears are simple! Just take off the wheels and compress the springs and pull them out. Make sure on installation that the notches are all lined up. 4 A great upgrade is lighting. Taillights are simple, just a few screws and a thumbscrew. Just swap the wires. Headlights are just as easy. 3 bolts on top and one underneath. I recommend just leaving that one out. It doesn\u0027t hold it in any more than the 3 up top. Swap in the new headlights and connect the wiring connector. 5 One final upgrade I suggest is an underdrive pulley. There has been debate on this topic, but personal research has shown a mild response increase. Undo the serpentine belt from the crankshaft pulley, and remove the bolt. Put the new pulley on and install a shorter belt. Reader Questions and Answers Unanswered Questions Show more unanswered questions Add New Question Answered Questions Don\u0027t see your question?

You’ll need: Ad Steps 1 Figure out where to mount the bars.  On a 2004 Jeep Liberty, there are 4 factory-drilled holes on the top of the crossbars.  If you line up the bars with those holes, which guaranteed they’d be parallel to each other. 2 Drill holes for eye bolts.  If you’re interested in adding eye bolts to help tie down loads, this is a good point to drill holes for them.  Find out what diameter your eye bolts are.  Choose a drill bit that is exactly the same size.  Note: even if you don’t want to have the eye bolts on your bars all the time, you might as well drill the holes now so that you don’t have to later.  Since you’re just using ordinary hardware, you can add or remove the eye bolts anytime you want. 3 Drill holes for U-bolts.  Lay the crossbars on your side rails and grab one of your U-bolts.  Using your U-bolt, mark where holes need to be drilled on the underside of your crossbar.  Repeat for the other side, and the second bar.  Drill where you marked.   Note: you’ll notice in the early pictures that four holes are drilled per side, and none are drilled for the U-bolts. The original plan was to secure the crossbars using regular hex bolts inserted through the crossbar and into the side rail. U-bolts were used instead, so those holes became superfluous. 4 Grind. Notice that the side rails on the Jeep are curved.  That is the case for most vehicles.  If you use square tubing and just rest the tubes on the curved side rails, nothing will sit flat across your cross bars, and they will look bad.  One solution is to use circular steel tubing.  The other solution is to grind out some metal from each place where the tubing rests on the side rails.  You’ll need a metal grinder for this step.  Take off a tiny bit at a time until you see that the bars are beginning to line up parallel. 5 Paint.  When you see that the bars will sit the way you want them to, choose a color of spray paint, hang your rails and hardware, and paint them.  This is strictly unnecessary, but the extra effort and $5 will make your DIY crossbars look great. 6 Mount.  Once everything is dry, place your crossbars on the side rails, slide the U-bolts through underneath, and tighten the nuts until it becomes somewhat difficult to turn the wrench by hand.  If you want to prevent scratching to the side bars, add a small piece of gasket between the side bars and the cross bars before tightening the U-bolts.  You want the U-bolts to be firm, but they don’t need to be so tight that they crush your side rails.  You should be able to grab a hold of the rails and rock the vehicle without the bars moving. 7 Buy yourself a nice dinner.  You just saved somewhere between $50-$200 dollars! 8 Reader Questions and Answers Unanswered Questions Show more unanswered questions Add New Question Answered Questions Don\u0027t see your question?

Learn to mix Bondo and save money, as Bondo, also called body putty, is considerably less expensive than a body shop. Applied correctly, Bondo repairs are durable and long-lasting. Ad Steps 1 Cut a thick piece of cardboard about 6 by 6 inches (15.24 cm by 15.24 cm). Alternatively, you can mix it on particle board or buy an inexpensive pad of disposable plastic sheets to mix the Bondo. 2 Open the can and mix the Bondo with a stir stick if there is a layer of liquid on top. Use the stir stick to lift a golf ball-sized dollop of filler out of the can and reseal the can. Mix a larger amount of Bondo and hardener if the area you need to patch is larger. Look at your project to estimate the amount of Bondo needed. 3 Add 1 line of hardener--also known as a catalyst or fixing agent--by squeezing it out of the tube across the top of the Bondo filler. (Bondo comes with a tube of hardener.) If you add too much hardener, the mixture will gel too quickly. If you add too little, it increases the amount of time for it to cure, and if you don\u0027t add enough it will never cure. If you add 1 line of hardener across the top of the dollop of Bondo, it takes about 15 minutes to dry after applying. Add 2 lines and it takes about 5 minutes to dry. Experiment to get the right Bondo mixture. 4 Use an ice cream novelty stick or a plastic spreader to quickly mix the two substances together. Do not whip them, but rather fold them to avoid introducing air bubbles. Use hardener with dye in it so you can see when the mixture is mixed evenly. If there are no streaks in the filler or areas that are darker or lighter, it is mixed well.

So when it stops in the highway, a few fundamental check ups will tell the driver whether the vehicle can be pushed by someone or if it has to be towed instead. Ad Steps 1 Check to see if there is any leakage or blockage in the flow of fuel. If there is fuel in the tank when the vehicle flutters, jitters, has abnormal and intermittent jerks before it stopped, stop the leakage, if any, with soap, glue, string, tape, or whatever you can find that could stop it. If there is a blockage, however, you are helpless. 2 Check the electrical system, especially the ignition wires, fuse box, loose wiring, air conditioning coil, battery charge, and the electrical fuel pump. If the vehicle halted suddenly with surprising smoothness, you might be able to fix loose wires to where they should be connected. If you do this, remove a terminal of the battery, or else there will be sparks. 3 If the fuse is blown, you can either replace it with another fuse available in that box, which only controls devices like the horn and lights, or take some silver paper of a cigarette pack, roll it to the shape of the fuse, and put it in the place of fused fuse. If the battery is completely discharged, stop another vehicle nearby and bench charge from that vehicle. Your car can be started once and moved until you reach a garage, without starting the engine. 4 Check the spark plugs if the engine starts but runs erratic.

The highly-regarded ASE certification reflects your special skills, attention to quality, and professional experience. It\u0027s worth the effort to obtain ASE certification. Ad Steps Part 1 Getting Experience 1 Secure a position as a technician or service employee in the automotive industry. To achieve ASE certification, you need at least two years of experience working in the industry in some capacity. You can elect to take the test first, provided you\u0027ve secured employment, but it won\u0027t go into effect until after you\u0027ve worked for two years. It\u0027s up to you if you want to work first or take the test. The two-year experience requirement can be waived if you have completed a three- to four-year apprenticeship program or two-year co-op program. The two years of shop experience or automotive schooling proof sign off form is required and available on ASE.com web site. There is also a student ASE program. You can pass the ASE tests as you take them in school and get a student ASE certification. As soon as you finish the school or the two year experience requirements, you would be awarded the full ASE certification. 2 Specialize. There are specific certifications and corresponding tests for those certifications. As you work in a garage or other kind of auto shop, decide what you\u0027d like to ultimately specialize in. What do you like working on best? What are you the best at? Use your two years of experience to practice and answer that question. 3 Select a specific certification to seek out. Each certification involves a series of tests, covering a specific subject matter. For instance, you can become certified in: Automobile/Light Truck Medium/Heavy Truck Parts Specialist Truck Equipment Undercar Specialist Advanced Engine Performance Specialist Damage Analysis and Estimating Engine Machinist Alternate Fuels 4 Understand why certification matters. ASE is a non-profit organization that formed as a way of improving the quality of automotive services in the United States. It serves car owners by making experienced and certified technicians easy to find, and it helps technicians drum up visibility for their skills and abilities. Business is better for everyone, and many shops will be more willing to hire ASE-certified technicians. Typically, you\u0027ll renew every five years, making it an important investment for your career. The more certifications and the more experience you have, the more valuable of a technician you will be to your customers and employer. Part 2 Getting Certified 1 Choose a certification test. There are more than 40 tests available, some of which may be required for the particular kind of certification you hope to attain, some of which may be required by your employer. Choose the kind of certification you\u0027ve specialized in. If you want to become certified in Automotive and Light Truck work, for example, you\u0027ll need to take the A Series tests, which includes nine tests on subjects like Brakes, Suspension \u0026 Steering, and other topics. If you pass all the tests in a given series then you will be awarded a master certification. 2 Register for the test. You can register for the test online by logging on to the National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence website at www.ase.com and submitting your registration materials, including your experience requirement signed off by your employer. You can browse the various types of certification, the tests involved, and time frames the test would be open. Then you can find a test center close to you, and request study materials from the website.[1] If you favor the analog, you can call the ASE toll-free number, at 1-866-427-3273 and mail completed registration materials and payment for fees to ASE, P.O. Box 4007, Iowa City, IA 52243 regular mail, or overnight to ASE, Tyler Building (86), 301 ACT Drive, Iowa City, IA 52245. 3 Request study materials and study hard. You can request sample tests from ASE for between $12 and $15 and it\u0027s strongly recommended that you request these materials to use in your test preparation. It\u0027s better to spend a little money now and do your best possible job on the test so you don\u0027t have to take it more than once, paying another registration fee and stressing yourself out about a test.[2] Even if you know your stuff, get a sample test. Just looking at the kinds of questions you\u0027ll be asked will be helpful. You can also go to your local book store and look at the ASE test prep books they may have. ASE also offers free test review tips on their website.[3] 4 Find a test center in your area. ASE works with a company called Promeric who provides several hundred testing centers across the US and Canada. Find one close to you. Once you\u0027ve registered, you can schedule an appointment to come in and take the test any time you\u0027re ready. These tests are done on a computer unless you request the written test. 5 Take the test. Report to the ASE testing center at the required time on the day of testing. Arrive a little early to fill out any paperwork for the test center. To be admitted, you\u0027ll need to provide the admission ticket printed out online or received in the mail within 14 days after your registration submission. You will also need to provide proof of work experience or completion of approved training or apprenticeship programs. Do not forget to bring a picture identification and admission ticket or you will not be able to take the test. Relax and do your best on the test, then go home and wait. You\u0027ll receive your test results about 4 weeks after the testing. If you pass, celebrate. If you don\u0027t, keep studying and take the test again. Some of the new computer tests will give you results in as little as 10 days. If you passed, then you will be mailed out the awarded certification. You can print a temporary certification from the web site. Part 3 Using Your Certification 1 Display the ASE logo on your website and at your garage. Smart consumers know to look for the very best in the field. If you\u0027re an ASE-certified technician, that means you\u0027re the best. Display the logo prominently to let people know you\u0027re good at what you do.[4] If you want to use the logo in print, contact ASE for information. Send them the URL of your website for approval. The logo is trademarked, but you\u0027re strongly encouraged to go through the extra step of getting it onto your publicity materials. 2 Consider going for your Master Technician status. Keep climbing the ranks and working, making yourself an attractive candidate for better and better jobs, including pay raises. Master Technician status can be achieved by passing a certain groups of tests in the specialization series of your choice. You can achieve master certifications in multiple areas, like light and heavy vehicles or buses. See the ASE.com web site for requirements, since they may change at any time. 3 Keep your certification up to date. Take the recertification exam every 5 years to maintain your credentials.

A few tricks and a little patience will usually open a stuck hood, but there are worst case scenarios that take protracted fiddling. Once you do open the hood, always address the underlying problem before you close it again. Ad Steps Method 1 Bypassing a Failed Latch or Cable 1 Press down on the hood while engaging the interior latch. If the cable between the latch and hood is sticky or stretched, it may not disengage the latch properly. Most cars are designed to disengage the cable when you press down on the front of the hood. Do this while your assistant pulls the interior latch. If it works, the hood will shift and raise slightly, and can then be opened with the exterior latch.[1] 2 Pull on the cable from inside the car. Locate the cable under the dashboard, near the interior release latch. Tug gently on this cable and see what happens: If the hood opens, your cable may have slipped or stretched. Try to adjust it at the front end, or replace it if you see any damage. (Less commonly, your interior release latch could be broken.) If you feel no tension at all, the cable is no longer attached to the front latch. Continue to the next step. Once you open the hood, check to see whether you can slip it back on, or whether the cable has snapped and needs replacement. 3 Locate the latch through the grille. At this point, you need a way to reach the latch or cable from another angle. If you\u0027re lucky, you can see the latch through the front grille. Investigate with a flashlight and a small mirror until you find a hook-shaped object.[2] Alternatively, the latch may be accessible from the driver\u0027s side fender well. In many cars, such as Hondas, the latch cables are run through the inner driver\u0027s side fender well. Remove the inner fender well clips and reach in. Pull the cable to pop the hood open. This will only work if the cable itself is still attached to the hood latch. 4 Trip the latch with a thin tool. Once you find the latch, reach in with a long, thin screwdriver. If the gaps in the grille are small, use a wire coat hanger instead. Hook this over the latch and tug.[3] You can remove the grille to get more direct access. Even replacing a non-removable grille might be cheaper than taking the car to a mechanic, depending on your model. 5 Approach it from under the hood. If you can\u0027t operate the latch from the front, your last chance is to reach under the hood and attempt to tug the cable with a pair of pliers, or reach all the way to the latch. This will be much easier if you jack the car and refer to the owner\u0027s manual. Warning: if the engine was on recently, let the car cool off before reaching under the hood. If this doesn\u0027t work, take the car to a mechanic. Removing the front bumper yourself may end up more expensive than paying for a repair. Method 2 Opening a Stuck Hood 1 Park the vehicle. Park the car on a level surface and engage the parking brake. Park at home or at an auto garage if possible. If it turns out you can\u0027t fix the problem on the spot, you don\u0027t want to be forced to close your hood again to drive to a mechanic. 2 Locate the release latch. If you\u0027re not familiar with the car, look for the interior release latch under the steering wheel, low down near the driver\u0027s door, or in the corner of the glove box. This often has a picture of a car with an open hood. Some older cars only have an exterior release. Look for a latch under the front lip of the hood. If you are locked out of the car, skip ahead to fixes that do not require interior access. 3 Test the interior release latch. When working correctly, this causes the hood to move upward a short distance. If you hear a noise but the hood does not move at all, the hood is probably stuck. Continue to the next step to fix it. If you do not hear anything, there\u0027s likely a problem with the cable or latch mechanism. Skip down to the next section. If the hood does open partially, all you need to do is press the exterior latch at the front of the hood. This latch is usually at the center or just to one side, and may depress upward or to the side. 4 Slap the hood to get it unstuck. Stand outside the driver\u0027s seat and reach in to hold the interior release in the fully pulled position. With your other hand, slap the hood with an open palm.[4] If you\u0027re lucky, the hood just needs a jolt. Take care not to dent your hood. You may need to use force, but keep your hand in an open palm position. 5 Attempt to open the hood with an assistant. Have a friend pull the interior release and keep it in that position. Stand at the front of the vehicle and pull up on the hood slowly but steadily.[5] If the only problem is rust or grime, you can usually overcome it. If the hood won\u0027t budge, don\u0027t force it. 6 Leave the engine running in cold weather. Chilly weather or frost can cause the hood to stick. Let the engine idle for a while to thaw frozen parts, then try opening the hood again.[6] If the hood still won\u0027t open, the cable or latch mechanism might be at fault. Continue to the next section to keep troubleshooting. 7 Inspect the latch after opening. Once you get your hood open, check for broken latch parts or a frayed cable, which needs replacing. If you don\u0027t see obvious problems, just lubricate the latch with a penetrating oil.[7] It may also help to lubricate the cable with a spray lubricant. Insert the straw nozzle at the cable\u0027s end, between the inner cable and outer sheath. Pinch the area with a cloth and spray. Do not use silicone spray under your hood. It can contaminate the oxygen sensor, throwing off engine performance. Reader Questions and Answers Unanswered Questions Show more unanswered questions Add New Question Answered Questions Don\u0027t see your question? Ask it here: Submit Tips If you can\u0027t repair a faulty cable on the spot, tie a string around the latch before closing the hood. Most hoods do not stay up on their own. Once open, lift the prop rod and use it to support the hood. Some older cars have a hood with hinges at the front, and can simply be lifted up. An accident can shift the latch mechanism and prevent it from working properly. You may be able to manually adjust the latch position to fix this. Only do so if you\u0027re sure it\u0027s in the wrong position. Warnings Always keep your keys on you when working on your car. That way, nobody can take off with car or start it when you are working, nor will you accidentally lock yourself out of the car with the keys inside it. Always make sure you close the hood securely before driving. If the hood is not latched properly, it may fly open on the road due to aerodynamic forces. This can obscure the driver\u0027s vision, or even detach the hood entirely at high speeds.

There are a number of different flame patterns to choose from, such as realistic flames, ghost flames and identical flames. Adding flames can be time-intensive, but you can use these steps to learn how to paint flames yourself. Ad Steps 1 Determine what color flame pattern you want. Check out popular car magazines to find a sample that you like. 2 Wash your car with a grease and wax remover. Ensure that the area where you will be painting the flames is spotless. Allow to dry before proceeding. 3 Sand the panels that will be painted with wet 600-grit sandpaper. It is important to ensure that the surface is completely smooth. 4 Clean the area with pre-paint cleaner. 5 Use fine line tape to map out the flame pattern. Though thicker tape may be used, thinner tape will result which could in fewer wrinkles, result in blurred lines. 6 Cover the flames and tape completely with transfer paper. Use a plastic- filler spreader to smooth out any wrinkles. 7 Cut down the center of the fine line tape all around the design with a utility knife. Be careful not to press too hard or the base paint may be scratched. 8 Cover the remainder of the car with plastic or masking paper. This will prevent any errant paint splatters. 9 Wipe with pre-paint cleaner to remove any errant fingerprints or resulting oil. 10 Spray with adhesion promoter. 11 Paint as desired.

Plasti dip is a substance utilized for wheels and cars to protect their original surfaces during the winter season. Plasti dip is a high quality product that is resistant to sun fading, winter ice, cold, and salt. It is also a durable yet removable substance that will peel off after a long period of time. Most importantly, anyone can use this product to display a clean and matte look for his or her car while completely remaining free of harm. Ad Steps 1 Find a suitable area. Find an area that is large enough to house the car and is extremely ventilated. A good suggested area would be an open garage, but if that is not possible, outside under the shade is a good area. Avoid direct sunlight. 2 Gather materials. Gather the materials needed listed in the Things you’ll need section. 3 Properly Wash and Clean the surface. Before applying any type of plasti dip to the car, it must be clean. The plasti dip is an overlay so it will form a separate layer on top of any surface as well as dirt, raised surfaces, or bird poop found on the car. In other words, you want a clean surface to work with. 4 Surface MUST be dry.After cleaning the area, dry it with a cloth of your choice. Personally I use Meguiar\u0027s Water Magnet Drying Towel, but you can use any terry towel. Avoid using shirts with designs or logos and paper towels.These will create scratches. 5 Prepare the area. Although plasti dip is already easy to remove, you would want to prepare the area. Preparing the area you wish to apply the plasti dip reduces the hassle of removing the over spray later. Using painters tape and newspapers, cover windows and any designated area that you do not want to get plasti dip on. 6 Shake the can. As with any spray-on material, it will need vigorous shaking. Shake the can for 1 minute. 7 Paint in sections.Painting in sections will allow for the fastest time(6-8 hours) through this process. For example, add a first layer to the hood, while the hood is drying add a first layer to the roof, etc. You do not need to start on the hood. You may start wherever you like.- important note! do not touch Plasti dip on car at any point in time during the process as to avoid any mis-painted spots. Plasti dip is safe to touch after curing. It is recommended to wear a mask and eye protection. 8 Spray the first layer.It is very important that this layer is a light dusting because the first layer is the bonding layer meaning it will be a 50 -60% transparency. This will allow the rest of the layers to bond and stick to the paint. Spray in a clean sweeping motion, making sure to hold the can 6–8 inches (15.2–20.3 cm) away from the area. Allow plasti dip to dry 15-30 minutes depending on climate, before adding the next layer 9 Spray additional layers.Increasing the layers on top of the first will only increase the durability of the plasti dip. The average amount of layers is 4-5. Any additional amount of layers is up to personal satisfaction. The layers after the first will be light  layers in which you will fully coat the area. Spray in a clean sweeping motion, making sure to hold the can 6–8 inches (15.2–20.3 cm) away from the area. Remember Allow 15-30 minutes of drying time in between each layer. 10 Tape/newspaper removal.After the final layer is applied, immediately remove any painter\u0027s Tape or newspaper that may have been used, from the immediate area, and toss them in the trash. Remove before plasti dip dries. 11 Cure time. At this point the plasti dip will take 4 hours to fully cure. At ALL costs, avoid any form of liquid, or any substance that may cause damage to the area. It may ruin the curing process. 12 Spray car accessories.For car accessories such as emblems and the grille, repeat steps 1 - 11. Spray onto emblems or grille only.    - important note! if the car is currently in the curing process, wait until car is fully cured before preparing the area. Spraying the car accessories can be done while painting the main body of the car. 13 Plasti dip rims.The cleanest way to apply plasti dip your rims is to remove the wheels completely from the car. Follow respective car manual on how to remove entire wheel from car. Repeat steps 1-11 for the rims. It is completely optional to cover the rubber of the wheel as plasti dip is easily removable. But covering the rubber ensures easy clean up.

Ask it here: Submit Video To view how it is done using a spray gun Tips Do not try to do this fast, because you will mess up. It is recommended to use a professional spray gun from your local hardware and appliance store as well as a bucket of plasti dip instead of cans. But it can be done with the can and a regular spray trigger. To maintain its durability, it is suggested to minimally apply 4-5 coats for a matte look Shake cans really well before spraying. If not it will spray clear. It is best to use 3 X 5 index cards to cover the surrounding of the tires, so you don’t paint the tires. Do not spray too close because “it will be too thick” and it will “bubble up with pin holes” (Fonzie, B) also, do not spray too far because it will get very textured. When prepping the area to be painted, tape at least 3–5 inches (7.6–12.7 cm) away from the area to be painted to allow over spray for easy removal. The perfect distance to spray is exactly 6 in away from the part. Try to keep the same distance. The car will have a matte finish, but there are products that will give it a glossified look such as Performix glossifier. For big projects as plasti dipping the whole car, use a spray trigger. This is for comfort and reduces the chance of hand cramps. Remember projects like this take time and patience. Rushing will only lower the quality of work. My personal suggestion is to do the rims and the body of the car on separate days to ensure highest quality work. Although it is possible to do the entire car in one day. Have patience and your car will look exactly as you wanted. Warnings Wash hands after using. Extremely flammable harmful vapor. Irritates eyes, skin and respiratory tract.

Whenever you get light scratches in your car glass, consider polishing the scratches away. The first step in polishing your glass is cleaning the exterior and interior sides. Then, polish the exterior side of the glass and apply a sealant. Ad Steps Method 1 Clean the Windows 1 Choose the right time and place. When washing your car, cleaning and polishing the windows should be the last thing you do. You should also clean the glass while working out of direct sunlight, while the windows are fairly dry. Otherwise, the sun may dry out the glass cleaner, leaving streaks behind. 2 Select the right supplies.[1] A glass cleaner specifically labeled for automotive use is better than an ordinary household glass cleaner, which often contains ammonia and other chemicals that can be dangerous for use on cars. A microfiber towel is also a necessity, since it has enough abrasiveness to gently scrub the surface of the glass without scratching it. 3 Roll down the windows halfway. You need to be able to have clear access to the top edge of the glass. 4 Spray the glass cleaner on the window. Clean the glass by wiping the cleaner onto the window using your microfiber cloth, moving from side to side. Cover both sides of the glass. 5 Use the dry side of the microfiber cloth. Remove any remaining wetness on your windows by drying them with the dry side of the cloth. 6 Roll your windows up and clean the bottom half. Spray with glass cleaner, wipe the cleaner on, and wipe the cleaner off. 7 Clean your front and back windshields. Spray the cleaner on the windshields and wipe it with your microfiber cloth, moving both up and down and side to side. Remove the dampness with the dry side of your cloth. 8 Rinse with water. Once the stubborn grime has been cleaned off your windows, you can remove any streaks or film with clean, plain water. Gently spray the glass, using a hose for the outside and a spray bottle for the inside. Wipe the glass dry with a clean microfiber towel. Method 2 Polish the Windows 1 Select a glass polish. There are many glass polishers available on the market. You can either select a glass polishing kit, which comes complete with specialized polishing discs that can remove more severe scratches or blemishes, or you can simply choose a high quality glass restorer that removes light spots and scratches.[2] 2 Use a low-speed rotary polisher. The polisher needs to have a speed setting between 1000 and 1200 RPM, and it must have a polishing pad. 3 Apply lubricating oil to the polishing pad.[3] The oil helps the polish to spread more, reducing the amount of polish you need to use, thereby reducing the amount of abrasiveness. 4 Apply the polish to the polishing pad. Use as much as directed on the product label, or apply an even spread of polish across the entire pad. 5 Start at the upper corner of the glass. Hold the handle with your dominant hand and use your other hand to guide the polisher. Do not apply pressure, since the pad will apply enough pressure on its own to polish the glass. 6 Cover the entire glass. Move the machine from side to side at a gradual pace. Do not jerk the rotary polisher around, since doing so will increase the likelihood of accidentally damaging your glass. Keep going until the entire surface of the glass has been moistened with polish, and stop the machine once the polish begins to dry. Be aware of the fact that the rotary polisher has a specific pattern of movement. When moved to the right, the machine also moves upward. When moved to the left, the machine also moves downward. Do not fight the rhythm of the machine. Instead, learn to work with it. 7 Buff the remaining polish residue away. Use a clean microfiber cloth to buff the residue away using even, gentle pressure and a small circular motion. Continue buffing until no streaks or residue remains. 8 Apply a glass sealant. Your car glass is now completely stripped. A glass sealant helps the glass stay smooth and clear for a longer period of time by sealing the pores of the glass. Apply a small amount of sealant onto an automotive sponge and wipe the sponge across the glass, moving from side to side and up to down. Use as much sealant as necessary to seal the entire exterior surface of the glass.

Otherwise, you\u0027re going to have flat tires, a dead battery...and that\u0027s just the start of the problems that you\u0027ll have. SO If you plan to store your car 6 months or less, here\u0027s what you do: Ad Steps 1 Wash and wax exterior of your car. If you don\u0027t clean and protect the paint, any dirt or contaminants left on the car will corrode the paint, and turn into rust. 2 Clean and vacuum interior. Again, dirt and debris can cause damage if left to sit for an extended period of time. 3 Top off fluids. A full fluid reservoir will leave no space for condensation to occur. 4 Change oil and filter. Old oil will become acidic and eat away at the inside of your engine. However, fresh oil will take much longer to break down. So, your engine seals should remain in good condition throughout the storage. 5 Grease steering and suspension components. A full grease service will keep the seals, and rubber bushings in your suspension from drying out while the car\u0027s in storage. 6 Disconnect battery (for older vehicles). If your battery is left connected, its charge will completely deplete, causing one or more of the inner cells to go bad. 7 Place battery on a trickle charger (newer vehicles that require a constant source of power). Most newer vehicles are equipped with advanced computer systems, which require constant power. Otherwise, they\u0027ll have to be completely reprogrammed. 8 Top off fuel tank and add fuel stabilizer. A full tank means that there\u0027s less room for condensation, and a stabilizer will keep the gas from breaking down and evaporating. 9 Make sure parking brake is not engaged. If your vehicle sits for an extended period of time with the parking brake on, the brake pads can rust to the rotor/drum, causing the wheel to seize. Instead, use a set of wheel chocks to keep the vehicle in place.

Understand how to prepare your car for long-term storage by following basic maintenance and service. Doing so will go a long way to protecting your car and helping you use it again when you are ready to take it out of storage. Ad Steps 1 Check your paperwork. Renew your registration if it will expire while you store your vehicle, or set a reminder to do so when it is due. Also, contact your insurance company to inform them that you will be storing your car and confirm your car is fully covered by your existing insurance policy. 2 Service your car. It is important that your engine and fluids are in good shape before you store your vehicle for a long period. Otherwise, you risk having your car not start when you are ready to use it again. Change or top off fluids which may contain sediments as appropriate. This includes oil (Synthetic oil breaks down more slowly with time which makes it preferred for storage), coolant, transmission, and brake fluid. Run out windshield washer fluid in regions susceptible to freezing to protect spray hoses from freeze and thaw cracks. Fill your car with gasoline as it leaves less airspace for moist air to enter the engine and form condensation (or ice) and add a fuel stabilizer available at any hardware/parts store. Check belts, filters, hoses, and other components of your engine. Ensure that all are in working order and clean. 3 Lubricate the car. Oil the hinges of the hood, doors, and trunk. Use a graphite-based lubricant for locks. Coat rubber parts of the doors and tires with silicone or white lithium grease. This will help prevent them from freezing shut. 4 Clean the interior. Throw away any trash. Vacuum seats and floor mats to prevent damage. Do not use chemical protectant (i.e. Armor All) on leather, vinyl, and other fabric as these may stain or cause excessive chemical damage to surfaces. Wash the inside of your windows. Getting the interior of your car in shape before storing it will prevent smells and potential damage from the sun or heat. 5 Care for the exterior. Wash, buff, and wax your car. Have it detailed, if possible. Make sure to clean the underside of your car as anything stuck to the bottom of the car acts like a sponge, trapping moisture that could lead to the creation of rust. Remove wiper blades or lift them up so they do not become deformed or flat. Ensure all leaves, pine needles, and other debris have been removed from the engine compartment and the windshield wiper cowl (The black thing between the hood and the windshield where the wipers come out of.) 6 Ensure that the battery is fully charged. Electronics can quickly drain the power of your battery, so make sure it is charged before you store your vehicle. You can also consider using a trickle charger. Disconnect your battery if storing for more than 6 months. Take the disconnected battery someplace temperate and dry (A Basement). 7 Deflate your tires to 10psi less than manufacturers recommendation and place the vehicle on jack stands if storing for more than 6 months. This allows the rubber to relax and prevents cracking while allowing you to still drive on them when you remove the vehicle from storage. There are theories of \"Flat Spots\" if a vehicle is stored on the ground, but newer tires are engineered to prevent this and any flat spots will be worked out within 100 miles (160 km) or so. This does not apply to antique vehicles (Ford Model \"X\" or vehicles with non-belted tires) 8 Cover your vehicle. Vehicle covers protect your car from sun damage, dust, and minor dings. Try to find a vehicle cover designed for long-term storage. These will not trap moisture, but allow your vehicle to breathe.

Taking a vehicle to a shop is usually an expensive proposition in the best of situations. If you\u0027re unlucky enough to meet up with a dishonest mechanic, the experience will be stressful and even more expensive. Although most mechanics are trustworthy, knowing what to look for will help you avoid the bad apples. Ad Steps 1 Find a trustworthy mechanic before you actually need one so that you won\u0027t be pressed into locating one in a hurry if your car suddenly breaks down. Ask friends and family for recommendations, then take your car to the shop for something simple such as an oil change. 2 Trust your instinct. If you have a feeling or intuition that the mechanic is less than trustworthy, take your vehicle elsewhere. Take your car to a second mechanic for another opinion if the estimate sounds high, or if something just doesn\u0027t seems right. If your car isn\u0027t running, call a tow truck. You aren\u0027t obligated to stay with a mechanic just because he looked at your car and gave you an estimate. 3 Prevent rip-offs by contacting the Better Business Bureau, AAA (American Automobile Association) and the Consumer Affairs Office in your city or state. Ask if there have been any complaints about the mechanic, and if so, how the problems were resolved. 4 Look for shops with an ASE symbol on the sign, which indicates the shop met the criteria for Automotive Service Excellence. The symbol should be not only on the sign, but on a certificate on the wall and usually on the mechanic\u0027s uniform. Shops approved by AAA (American Automobile Association) are also a good bet. AAA approval means that the work must be guaranteed for 6,000 miles (9,700 km) or six months. 5 Be familiar with your vehicle. Read your vehicle\u0027s manual and stay current with recommendations for oil changes and other maintenance schedules. Being familiar with your vehicle will help you prevent auto repair rip-offs. 6 Ask if the shop has experience dealing with your type of car. For example, if you have a foreign car, be sure the mechanic has the experience and equipment to deal with your vehicle. 7 Make a checklist of what work your vehicle needs. If you aren\u0027t sure, outline the problems very clearly and find out exactly how the mechanic plans to deal with each problem. Be specific and never give a mechanic free reign to do whatever your car needs without discussing it with you first. 8 Get an itemized written estimate in advance and be sure the mechanic contacts you before doing any work that exceeds the original estimate. Read estimate carefully and ask questions if something seems odd or isn\u0027t clear. Ask if the parts and work are guaranteed. 9 Request a detailed invoice that includes costs of labor and parts. Check the bill carefully and ask for clarification on any discrepancies. Pay by credit card or check so that you have a record of payment and so you can stop payment if you think you\u0027ve been ripped off.

Here are 6 detailed steps and a few extra tricks for preventing rust on your car. Ad Steps 1 Wash your car every two weeks; once a week if it is wet with salt on the roads. 2 Wax your car once every four months. 3 Keep the inside clean as well, being sure to clean up after any spills which can start rust from the inside. 4 Salt speeds rust, so be careful to keep your car clean if you live by the ocean or in the winter when there’s salt on the road. 5 Clean the underside of your car and your wheel wells when filthy or at least once a week during the winter when salt is out. 6 If your car is seriously at risk for rust because of regularly exposure to salt, etc. you can clean it and then spray it with a lubricant appropriate for cars (we recommend Jig-a-loo, of course!) or even paint it with a proper coating for the surface (this should be done by a professional). 7 Know that if you are in a very salty climate or are already fending off rust problems, you may want to consider coating your car with a rust-preventing spray (like Jig-a-loo) 8 Key is to keep metal surfaces dry- whether you wipe them off after use, or protect them with paint, lacquer, lubricant or wax. 9 Learn that if you are going to spray your car with anything flammable. make sure the engine is cold and give it some time for the vapors to clear up before you fire it up again. Try to avoid spraying on your exhaust or mufflers so they don’t get too smelly when they are hot. Before any long periods on inactivity, wash and spray down a rust-preventing spray. Drive further behind other vehicles to prevent nicks from pebbles they kick up. Cover your car with a car cover whenever possible. 10 Examine your car for rust often.

This style of vehicle is also referred to as a \"drop top\" because it has a removable vinyl or cloth top that protects the interior. A convertible is more susceptible to UV light, dirt and other damage. However, because of its versatility, maintaining the interior of a convertible may take more care and cost than the average car. Cleaning and covering the interior of your convertible is essential for successful car maintenance and durability. Buy products that have been proven to work on your type of leather, cloth or vinyl interior, instead of using general car cleaning products. Learn how to protect the interior of a convertible. Ad Steps Method 1 Cleaning your Convertible 1 Remove all garbage from your car. This and most of these cleaning items should be completed every week to avoid odors, caked on dirt and a dusty interior. 2 Dampen a microfiber towel slightly. Wipe down all surfaces to remove dust and dirt. This can be done on vinyl, plastic and leather surfaces. 3 Wipe down the inside of your doors with the microfiber towel. 4 Shake out the floor mats to remove dirt before it reaches the carpet at the bottom of your convertible. Vacuum your floors every month to protect against dirt. After it remains for a period of time, it can become ingrained in the carpet and upholstery and nearly impossible to remove. 5 Buy a UV light protector that is specific to your type of interior. Convertible interiors are vinyl, plastic and leather. Consult your owner\u0027s manual if you do not know which type you have. Sunlight can cause fading, cracking, peeling and brittleness in your interior, so it is important to have a regular cleaning and protecting routine. Do not apply protector products without cleaning the surface first. 6 Apply the UV light inhibitor/protector to the dash, door panels and console every month. Use a foam applicator to brush on the inhibitor according to package directions. You can find UV light inhibitor at car parts stores, car detailing stores and online. 7 Clean and/or vacuum your upholstery regularly. Apply a UV light protector to your vinyl or leather upholstery every 3 months. 8 Buy a sunshade to put behind your windshield when you are parked in sunlight. Use it faithfully and your convertible interior will maintain its beauty for even longer. Method 2 Caring for Convertible Tops 1 Use a convertible top whenever your car is parked or not in use. The top will minimize the damage caused by weather, UV light and dirt. 2 Care for your convertible top regularly. The top is not only an integral part of the look of your car, it can also crack if not cared for properly. A protected top will mean a better car interior. 3 Buy a gentle car shampoo that is formulated for vinyl or cloth convertible tops, depending upon the material of your top. Do not buy a car cleaner that maximizes shine, since these formulas are made for the body of the car, not a matte vinyl or cloth top. 4 Spray your top with water and then spray it with your cleaner. Use an applicator with a soft brush to wash the top according to the product\u0027s instructions. This will help to remove dirt and debris. 5 Dry the surface of the top. Then, spray on vinyl or cloth convertible top protector. These products are available in detailing stores or online. Clean and protect your convertible top every month to keep it looking in good condition and protecting the rest of the interior. 6 Buy a special plastic cleaner for your clear vinyl windows. Apply this specialty product every month to prevent yellowing and cracking.

This method should be used as a method of last resort only if jumper cables and a live battery are not in reach. Ad Steps 1 Ensure that the standard vehicle cannot be started regularly through the use of it\u0027s key. The driver should also make sure to have his foot pressed all the way down on the clutch. The drivers foot should remain in this position until step 6. 2 Place the key in its keyhole and turn it all the way into the \"on\" position. (Regularly turning the key here would initiate the starter) Once the starter has failed to start the vehicle, the driver should shift into a gear. The car will now need to move by the use of physical force. One can either use gravity (hills) to their advantage or have the car pushed by someone else. Ask a passenger if they are willing to help push. 3 Immediately before the car is pushed, ensure that the key is in on position. Make sure the clutch pedal is pressed down and that it is in the correct gear (2nd gear is recommended). Make sure that it is safe to move the vehicle and take into account any affects gravity will have on the vehicle. Release the hand brake and have the car pushed or let it roll down a hill. 4 Once the car is pushed to a significant speed of approximately 10–25 km/h (6.2–15.5 mph) in 2nd gear (or reverse) or 25–40 km/h (16–25 mph) in 3rd gear, the driver will need to engage the clutch for a split second (this is known as popping the clutch). This is done by releasing the clutch pedal in it\u0027s entirety for a second or less and then pressing it back all the way down at a quick speed. If your foot is left off the clutch pedal for over a 2 seconds the car will stop moving and the battery will remain dead. 5 Be conscious that during the split second that the clutch pedal was released the car will have effectively started the engine. This will send mechanical power to the alternator, which will send electricity back to the battery. In other words, simply driving your car will recharge it\u0027s battery. 6 Leave the car on for approximately 15 minutes to allow the alternator enough time to recharge the battery. If it is not left on long enough the battery will still be considered dead once the car is shut off. 7 Get it checked. Now that your vehicle is moving, its next destination should be the garage. Make sure to have your cars dead battery checked by a professional.

Although it is a simple process, rebuilding hydraulic cylinders requires attention to details. Observing and pinpointing the area of damage is essential before moving on with the rebuilding operation. All you need is basic knowledge of working with tools in order to carry out this process. Ad Steps 1 Get adequate working space. Take out the cylinder from its machine and place it in an open area. With the help of a screw-driver, unscrew the shaft-side cover of your cylinder and then remove the bolts. Take out the piston. You can pull up the input valve in order to decrease pressure on the piston pump. 2 Rectify the problem. Visually inspect your hydraulic cylinder and find out the cause of damage. It could be that the shaft of your cylinder has ruptured or the seals have been damaged. Make sure that you thoroughly check each and every part of the cylinder to know the exact reason for the malfunctioning of your cylinder. 3 Take help of the local hydraulic cylinder repair service provider in order to repair the damaged part or get it replaced with a new one. The ruptured or scratched shaft can be honed by a professional. In case the shaft is broken, you can replace it with a new one. Similarly, replace the damaged seals with new one before reattaching them in the cylinder. 4 Remember the location of each seal before removal and at the time of reattachment. You can use old, damaged seals for reference. Buy a seal kit that will provide you with new seals as well as O-rings. Take help of the instruction manual in order to reattach the seals perfectly. 5 Precisely handle of all the parts. At first, you need to check that all the seals are firmly attached to their proper places and are oiled well. Then clean the piston and put it back in the cylinder. Then, tighten the input valves so as to build the air pressure back. Lastly, put the cover of the cylinder back on and tighten the screws.

Keep in mind, if you do not have the manufacturer\u0027s specifications and a charging manifold with gauges, you will not be able to do a professional job, but many people successfully recharge their AC with kits available at big box stores and auto parts retailers. Try to get a kit that includes a pressure gauge, this will make troubleshooting and charging easier. Be aware that this particular process is usually best left to a professional mechanic. Ad Steps 1 Determine if you have any refrigerant left in your system at all. To do this, you will need to fit a charging hose on the low pressure port, which is on the refrigerant line on your car, usually near the accumulator. Be sure to use eye protection. If your system is completely discharged, it may be contaminated with moisture, and charging will not give satisfactory results unless the source of the leak is found, repaired, and the receiver dryer is replaced. The open system must be repaired and purged using a vacuum pump to remove air and moisture. You will also want to add compressor oil if the system has been leaking. Evidence of oil leakage and measurement of oil left in a replaced compressor will be a guide as to how much oil to replace. 2 Check for any obvious leaks. If your system has lost sufficient refrigerant to quit working, you have a leak. Small leaks may take months to deplete the refrigerant so that the AC fails to cool, but charging a system with a significant leak is simply a waste of time. Look for refrigerant oil residue on hose, tubing, and fittings that are part of the refrigerant system. Spray a soapy water solution on fittings and watch for bubbles to appear, indicating a leak. 3 Make sure the condensing coils are not obstructed with debris, and that the compressor is operating. To test a compressor with a low charge you may need to jump the pressure switch, often located on the accumulator. 4 Tap your refrigerant can. This is done by completely opening the valve on the tapping fitting, which retracts the tapping pin into the valve body. Failing to do so will result in the tap puncturing the can when it is installed, releasing the refrigerant before the fitting is sealed. 5 Securely thread the tapping valve on the refrigerant can, close the valve completely shut. This drives the pin into the top of the can, making it possible to release the refrigerant when the valve is opened. 6 Purge the charging hose. Open the valve until you hear it fill with refrigerant, then slowly loosen the brass fitting that connects the hose to the valve. Be careful not to allow refrigerant to spray on bare skin, as this will freeze skin tissue on contact. Re-tighten the hose once you have heard refrigerant escaping; this should have forced any air (and moisture) from the hose. 7 Locate the low pressure charging port on the refrigerant line on your car. This will be on the larger tube, usually near or on the accumulator. Connect the quick coupling and make sure it is not leaking. 8 Crank your engine and turn the AC on high cool, high fan. If your recharging hose is equipped with a pressure gauge, check it to determine if the system needs refrigerant. If the pressure holds steady in the recommended range, the system is full and should not be charged. If the pressure is below the recommended range, follow the instructions to recharge the system. Another indicator that the system needs refrigerant is that the compressor cycles rapidly. If the compressor switches on and off every 5 to 20 seconds, it is most likely due to low pressure. You will see the pressure drop when the compressor kicks on, the compressor will shut off when the pressure gets too low, and the pressure rises back up to the operating range as the system equalizes. Compressor cycling (switching on and off) in a completely charged system should be very slow (every 30 seconds or up) or not at all present (compressor stays on) in hot weather. Be aware if the cooling fans for the radiator are on and functioning with while the AC system is on. If the compressor is on, the cooling fans should also be on to assist in cooling the freon in the condenser, located either in front or behind the radiator. Most vehicles have 2 fans, with one being dedicated to the AC system 9 Open the valve until you hear refrigerant passing through the hose. 10 Allow the can to dispense its contents. This often takes anywhere from two to five minutes. The hotter the outside temperature, the more quickly the contents will discharge. Keep the can with the tap up at all times, to allow non-liquid refrigerant into the suction side of the system to prevent compressor damage. Do Not overcharge! A manifold gauge should be used to measure both high and low side pressure. Consult a Pressure temperature chart. 11 Close the valve and disconnect the hose when the can is empty or no longer discharging enough to keep the can cold. Check the charging port for leaks, and replace the plastic cap. 12 Check the air from the AC vents in the car. It should be blowing cold (38-45 degrees), if not, either one can of refrigerant was not sufficient to charge the system, or some other component is the problem. Do Not overcharge! A manifold gauge should be used to measure both high and low side pressure. Consult a Pressure temperature chart.

While the system is charging and the engine is just above idle, you\u0027ll typically want a low pressure reading around 30 psi (200 kPa). The high pressure reading fluctuates greatly with engine speed, air humidity, and other factors, but a very rough rule of thumb is \"high pressure psi \u003d 2 x temperature in Fahrenheit.\" This is more accurate for R12 refrigerant, while R134a refrigerant tends to be a fair bit higher.

Click through the video to YouTube to view the second part. Tips Generally avoid a kit that contains a substance for sealing leaks. The sealant can harden in inappropriate places and cause problems; get the leak fixed properly, or, if it is a very slow leak, just leave it be. Later vehicles run on R134a. These systems have different size ports, making identification easy. If your car is earlier than approximately 1993, the air conditioning will operate on R12 which is now obsolete. However there are replacement refrigerants such as Freeze12 which will not require you to convert your system to R134a in order to recharge. You can get an R12 to R134a conversion kit at an auto parts store, but should consider having it done professionally. A DIY air conditioner recharge can be pretty risky. You can look at your manifold gauges for the Hi and Lo sides and determine if the system is low, but it won\u0027t tell you how low the system is. You need to be fairly accurate in the amount of freon you add in order to prevent damage and for the system to work. The only way to know how much freon is in the vehicle, is to remove it and weight it using an A/C servicing machine that recovers as well as charges. In most cases, it\u0027s best to take your car to a professional for this service. Warnings R-12 is now more expensive and can be found on eBay. Although it requires a license to buy, and to evacuate and recover a system. Getting caught doing so without a license will result in a fine and/or imprisonment. So it may be wiser to have your A/C converted to R-134A. This can easily be done with the retrofit conversion kits on the market now. Some even come with how to videos. R-12 is no longer used because it contains CFCs and is harmful to the environment if it gets out of the system. Don\u0027t mix R-12 and R-134 refrigerant. This is not illegal, but isn\u0027t efficient. R12 and R134a require different oil for lubrication. R-12 systems use a mineral oil, R-134a systems use a polyalkylene glycol (PAG) oil. A mixture of the two will displace more space than needed in the system and could result in an overfill, stressing the compressor. If you change the compressor, it is highly recommended to also change the filter/dryer and you may have to flush the condenser. Either Ester or PAG oil can be use on a conversion. Get a recharging kit that includes a pressure gauge. Beware that once the low side reaches around 30 psi the high side can continue to increase to excessive pressure levels if not monitored — do not overcharge, fix leaks use a manifold gauge set and be safe! One thing to consider with PAG oil is if it is left out it will absorb humidity and water. It also can become an acid and corrode your A/C system and cause leaks.

There are several causes which contribute to overall pollution, one of which includes the paints used within the auto paint industry. This type of paint contains solvents which are made up of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which leads to air pollution by producing ozone (which causes smog). Here are some simple measures which could minimize air pollution arising from auto painting: Ad Steps 1 Use High Volume vs. Low Pressure (HVLP) spray: 2 This can be achieved using a HVLP spray paint gun when painting, which can be connected to any traditional air compressor. HVLP helps by increasing the total volume of paint holding on the surface. As a result the pressure needed to propel the paint is significantly reduced. With the chance of paint adhering to the surface increased, up to 50% of paint can be saved from over-spray. 3 Two types of guns are: Siphon feed (cup below nozzle) – requires more pressure. Gravity feed (cup above nozzle) – requires less pressure. This is the recommended type to help keep over-spray to a minimum. 4 Use paints in which water can be added i.e. waterborne. They nullify the use of solvents. However, these types of paints are still under development as they remain less durable than conventional paints.

Once the body has dried, you need to deburr the component to remove any protrusions, dents, and ragged edges. Attach the rectangular shaped sandpaper disk to the bottom of the sander. Connect power sander to the power supply. Once the power has been turned on place the sander onto the component. Slowly move the sander in a linear motion across the length and breadth of the component. Concentrate on corners, edges, and areas where there may be depressions. 3 Prepare the Coating Room. Generally, coatings are spray painted onto metallic components. You need a separate room to perform this step. Mount a metallic hook and let it hang from the ceiling. Cover the room with plastic sheet paper to ensure that the coating will not leak or spread out of the room. Hang the component from the metallic hook. 4 Set up the Spray Paint Machine. Pour the coating into the machine’s coating can. Attach the coating can onto the machine. Connect the machine to the power supply. Ensure that the compressed gas used to perform the spraying process is working. 5 Coat the Component. Slowly spray the coating onto the component in long strokes. Coat the surface effectively by spraying in either a side to side or upwards to downwards motion. Using this action, completely spray the interior and exterior body of the component. Give the coating a few minutes resting time before you apply the second coat. 6 Cure the Component. Once the coating process has been completed, you need to cure the component. This allows the coating to solidify and thus provide the component the protection it needs. Transfer the component to a curing oven. Close the oven and set the temperature. The normal curing temperature is 200oF for about an hour. Start the oven and let it cure the component. 7 Remove and Inspect the Component. Once the curing process has been completed, remove the component and let it rest to reduce its temperature to normal. Once this is done, conduct a thorough inspection of the component to ensure that there are no defects in the component. 8 Package and Ship the Component. If the component turns out to have no defects, it can be packaged and shipped for delivery to the client.

Before you start the coating process, use the machine on a sample component to ensure that it is working properly. If you have an enormous curing oven, you can also use it as the coating room. This can help you to save time. Warnings Never perform the coating process without protective clothing. Always wear a chemical protective suit with a hood, rubber gloves, and chemical protective boots. Never coat the component without using an air purifying respirator in confined spaces.

By following these simple steps, you can save money, and get your bumper cover back to normal. Ad Steps Method 1 Leaving the Bumper Cover On 1 Determine if you can use this method. This will only work if your car allows you to get underneath it and access the dented area of the cover from the underside. If not, use the other method. 2 Turn on your heater blower. start to heat around the area of dent in circular motion. 3 Lay on the ground under the area where the dent is and have the heater blower ready to use. Heat the area of the dent from underneath the bumper cover. Heat around the dent in circular motion about 3-5 minutes. 4 Take an object or stick and push out the dent from behind the bumper cover. If you\u0027re wearing gloves, you may be able to push the dent out with your hand. Take note that some force is needed to completely push the dent out. 5 Continue until the dent pops out. Method 2 Removing the Bumper Cover 1 Open the trunk and remove tail lights. There will be screws and snaps that must be removed. Remove the screws behind the tail light inside your trunk. There will also be screws and snaps on top of the bumper cover (two underneath the tail light). 2 Remove the screws from under panel skirt attached to the bumper cover (if necessary). You\u0027ll need a screwdriver to do this. On some cars, there may also be snaps. 3 Undo the screws that connect the bumper cover to the quarter panel. 4 Take the bumper cover off of the vehicle. 5 Turn on the heater blower.

However, as an alternative you can repair and remove some kinds of dents from your car with the help of such common household items such as a hair dryer and either dry ice or a can of compressed air. Continue reading this article to learn how to remove dents from your car using these materials. Ad Steps Part 1 Preparing to Remove the Dent 1 Find your car\u0027s dents. This is an especially useful method for removing small-to-medium-sized dents, and you may have more of these then you think. Examine your car carefully to find them all. 2 Evaluate the dents. Dents can typically be removed using this method if they are located on the metal panels of the trunk, hood, doors, roof, or fenders, and are not right along the edges on broad flat surfaces.[1] To achieve the best results, use this method on shallow dents that do not contain major creases or paint damage, and that cover a surface area with a diameter of at least 3 inches (7.62 cm). 3 Obtain the materials needed to remove the dent. You will need a hair dryer, heavy-duty or thick rubber gloves for safe handling of the dry ice or compressed air in its liquid format, aluminum foil, and either a package of dry ice or a can of compressed air. You will need some of the following: Heavy-duty insulated rubber-coated gloves. A full (or nearly full) can of compressed air. A package of dry ice. A hair dryer with adjustable temperature settings, such as \"Low,\" \"Medium,\" and \"High,\" or \"Cool,\" \"Warm,\" and \"Hot.\" Aluminum foil. Part 2 Heating and Cooling the Dented Area 1 Apply heat to the dented panel. Turn on the hair dryer and use it to blow hot air over the dent and the surrounding area for one to two consecutive minutes. The hair dryer should be set to medium and should be held between 5 and 7 inches (12.7 and 17.78 cm) away from the car\u0027s surface. Do not overheat the area in order to prevent the paint from becoming damaged due to overheating.[2] 2 Insulate the dented area of the panel (if applicable). Place a sheet of aluminum foil over the top of the dented area. This step should only be performed if you are using dry ice instead of compressed air. The purpose of this step is to keep the area warm while also protecting the paint from the dry ice, which can potentially damage the topcoat. 3 Put on the heavy-duty gloves. The gloves will protect you from frostbite and other injuries that can occur when your skin comes into contact with dry ice or liquified compressed air. 4 Apply the dry ice or liquified compressed air. The rapid change in temperature from warm to cold will cause the surface of your vehicle to first expand (when heated) and then contract (when cooled).[3] If you are using dry ice, grab a block of the ice with one hand, then gently rub it over the aluminum foil resting on top of the dented area. If you are using a can of compressed air, turn the can upside down, and spray the surface of the dented area to cover the area with a layer of liquid ice. There are some basic principles of science at work here: the pressure, volume, and temperature of a gas are all interconnected. While normally the can loses temperature as the gas is released, if you spray the can upside down the gas itself is cooled.[4] Either method will only require a brief application. The surface panels of most modern vehicles are made of relatively thin and lightweight material and they will cool very quickly. You will likely not see any change after the first 30-50 seconds of application, if not sooner still. 5 Wait for a little while. A few moments after you have applied the dry ice or compressed air, you may hear a popping sound that will indicate the dent has been removed. The rapid temperature shift will usually make the material reform its original shape. If you used dry ice, remove and dispose of the aluminum foil after the dent has been removed. If you applied liquid ice by means of compressed air, wait for the white foam to dissipate from the surface of the car, then wipe residue away with a gentle cloth. 6 Repeat the process as needed. For certain dents a single application may not be enough. If you see improvement but a dent is still noticeable, you can begin the process of heating and cooling again. However, do no overuse this process (especially in a single day). While the rapid temperature changes can reshape your car exterior, the extreme cold is potentially hazardous to the paint.

The pilot bearing or bushing is inexpensive and does an important job. It keeps the input shaft to the transmission in perfect alignment with the crankshaft. If it is worn, it can cause vibration in the drive line and if it is of the ball bearing type it could become very noisy. It is easy to replace but unfortunately it requires a special tool to pull the bearing out of the end of the crank shaft and most do-it -yourselfers do not own the tool. But there is another way! Mechanics have, for over fifty years, used this method without the use of special tools. Ad Steps 1 Remove the transmission and clutch assembly. Once you have removed the transmission, the throw-out bearing fork, the clutch and plate look at the end of the crank shaft to see the bearing or bushing. Yes it can be a ball bearing, a needle bearing or a bronze bushing. It is simply pressed into the end of the crank shaft. Without the aid of a special puller, you can pop it out with just a small amount of thick grease, a wooden dowel and a hammer. 2 Insert grease. Using a flat blade screwdriver or other utensil, insert the thick grease, like that used on wheel bearings, into the cavity behind the pilot bearing. Make sure that the space is completely full of grease without any air gaps. 3 Use a wooden dowel to remove the bearing. Make or buy a wooden dowel that is the same diameter as the opening in the center of the bearing. It must fit snuggly or this trick won’t work. With the cavity behind the bearing filled completely with grease, place the dowel into the opening keeping it perpendicular with the bearing. Using a hammer or mallet strike the wooden dowel with a quick hard blow. The bearing should have moved outward a noticeable amount and in some cases will have popped out completely. You may have to add more grease to the cavity and repeat the operation, but it will come out. This is because the grease will not compress and the pressure exerted on the wooden dowel is transferred through the grease to the back of the bearing pushing it out. 4 Remove all the grease from the cavity. Press in the new bearing or bushing, reassemble the clutch system and install the transmission.

Occasionally the bearings will leak grease, and sometimes the wheel, or axle, bearing will begin to make noise during operation. In more serious cases, the axle bearing could cause gouging or scoring damage. To fix these issues, you will need to remove the axle bearing and replace it. Replacing axle bearings can be an intimidating task if you have never done it before. Learn how to remove axle bearings on your own. Ad Steps Part 1 Getting Started 1 Chose an appropriate surface. You are going to have to raise your car up off of the ground in order to remove the axle bearings, but you must never attempt to do so on uneven ground. You need a flat, stable surface. The relatively even concrete surface of a garage floor may be ideal; an angled driveway is not. http://pad1.whstatic.com/images/thumb/1/19/Remove-Axle-Bearings-Step-1-Version-2.jpg/550px-Remove-Axle-Bearings-Step-1-Version-2.jpg http://pad1.whstatic.com/images/thumb/1/19/Remove-Axle-Bearings-Step-1-Version-2.jpg/300px-Remove-Axle-Bearings-Step-1-Version-2.jpg //d5kh2btv85w9n.cloudfront.net/9/95/Remove Axle Bearings Step 1.360p.mp4 2 Apply the parking brake. While this is useful to prevent the wheels from moving as you raise the vehicle, it is even more important later when you will remove the bearings. http://pad2.whstatic.com/images/thumb/5/53/Remove-Axle-Bearings-Step-2-Version-2.jpg/550px-Remove-Axle-Bearings-Step-2-Version-2.jpg http://pad1.whstatic.com/images/thumb/5/53/Remove-Axle-Bearings-Step-2-Version-2.jpg/300px-Remove-Axle-Bearings-Step-2-Version-2.jpg //d5kh2btv85w9n.cloudfront.net/0/02/Remove Axle Bearings Step 2.360p.mp4 3 Raise the vehicle using a car jack. http://pad2.whstatic.com/images/thumb/1/17/Remove-Axle-Bearings-Step-3-Version-2.jpg/550px-Remove-Axle-Bearings-Step-3-Version-2.jpg http://pad1.whstatic.com/images/thumb/1/17/Remove-Axle-Bearings-Step-3-Version-2.jpg/300px-Remove-Axle-Bearings-Step-3-Version-2.jpg //d5kh2btv85w9n.cloudfront.net/0/04/Remove Axle Bearings Step 3.360p.mp4 There are several different types of car jacks, each of which work a little differently. The vast majority--including those that each car is typically equipped with--convert the user\u0027s force (applied a handle) to extend the head of the jack. As it extends, it will make contact with and then push whatever is in contact with the head. The most important thing regarding use of a jack (after finding a flat surface) pertains to placement of the jack. Most vehicle manuals will tell you where the jack must be placed, so read it. If the jack applies pressure in the wrong place, it can damage a door, tear wires, or punch a hole through a fluid tank. 4 Place jack stands under the vehicle. If you are going to get under a vehicle (as you must while performing this job), jack stands are highly recommended over regular car jacks. Jacks tend to be fairly narrow and somewhat unstable, and so are more suitable for quick tire changes. To use a car jack for this task is extremely dangerous and should not be attempted.[1] http://pad2.whstatic.com/images/thumb/8/87/Remove-Axle-Bearings-Step-4.jpg/550px-Remove-Axle-Bearings-Step-4.jpg http://pad2.whstatic.com/images/thumb/8/87/Remove-Axle-Bearings-Step-4.jpg/300px-Remove-Axle-Bearings-Step-4.jpg //d5kh2btv85w9n.cloudfront.net/d/d9/Remove Axle Bearings Step 4.360p.mp4 The jack stand must be placed under the car frame itself. You cannot place the stand under a fuel or oil tank or other weak spot; the weight of the car will destroy them. Obviously, though, for this job keep them clear from the area of the axles. (See more here.) Raise all 4 wheels of the car. This will ensure safety and precision in removing axle bearings. If you only raise 1 wheel or 1 side of the car, you run the risk of the car falling if it becomes unbalanced. Part 2 Removing the Axle Bearings 1 Remove the trays and coverings that are in the way. http://pad1.whstatic.com/images/thumb/b/b5/Remove-Axle-Bearings-Step-5.jpg/550px-Remove-Axle-Bearings-Step-5.jpg http://pad1.whstatic.com/images/thumb/b/b5/Remove-Axle-Bearings-Step-5.jpg/300px-Remove-Axle-Bearings-Step-5.jpg //d5kh2btv85w9n.cloudfront.net/6/62/Remove Axle Bearings Step 5.360p.mp4 Remove the engine tray (also known as the under tray) if applicable. This rests under the engine, and will usually obstruct your access to the axle. (Note, some vehicles do not have this, and others have had it removed and never replaced.) Remove the transmission tray. Remove any plastic covering that rests over the suspension wishbone. 2 Remove the tires. You will not have access to the axle bearings without first removing the tires. You will probably want to replace more than one axle bearing at a time (after all, if one is worn out then the other on that same axle probably will be soon as well), so remove all of the appropriate tires.

The car wax may not be streaking, but if the paint begins looking dull or no longer feels smooth, these may be signs that you need to reapply. Old car wax should generally be removed every three months or more often if exposed to harsh weather conditions. Ad Steps Method 1 Using Spray-On Pre-Wax Cleaner 1 Start with a freshly washed and dried car. Remove any surface dirt from the car\u0027s exterior by washing it using a non-drying soap and water. Dry it clean with soft cotton towels or by allowing it to air dry. By removing as much dirt from the surface as possible, you allow the chemicals in the pre-wax cleaner to get directly to the layer of wax instead of having to contend with layers of grime and gunk first. 2 Choose the right pre-wax cleaner.[1] Liquid pre-wax cleaners can be divided into two categories: spray on wax removers and non-abrasive polishes. Strictly speaking, a spray on wax remover is a more legitimate pre-wax cleaner. Spray on wax removers strip the wax off a car but do not do much else. They do not clean deep and do not remove contaminants that lurk below the surface. However, because they do not cleanse deeply, they make a good choice for someone who likes to frequently strip old wax and apply new wax. Non-abrasive polishes cleanse a little more deeply. They are used for less frequent strippings and clean dirt that settles beneath the surface of the paint. Their primary purpose is not to remove wax, but that is a secondary effect. 3 Spray the wax remover directly on the surface of the car. Apply the cleaner liberally, but make sure that you only get it on the paint of the car and not the plastic or rubber trim. If allowed to soak into plastic or rubber, wax removers have the tendency to discolor.[2] 4 Wipe the surface clean. Use a soft terry cloth to wipe the wax remover along the paint using side to side and top to bottom motions. Spread the wax remover using long, even strokes. 5 Reapply as necessary. If your first application of wax remover did not remove all the wax, you may apply another coating. Avoid repeating this too often, however, since too many applications on unprotected paint can gradually start to damage the point. 6 Apply all-purpose cleaner to the rag to clean the trim. Since plastic and rubber can become discolored when you use wax removers, a milder all-purpose car exterior cleanser is a better option. Apply the cleaner directly onto a clean terry cloth rag. 7 Gently rub the surface of the trim. Apply light, even pressure along the trim to remove as much of the old wax as possible. Method 2 Using Detailing Clay 1 Wash and dry your car before using the clay bar. It is best to remove surface dirt from the paint before using the clay bar. The amount of dirt particles being picked up by the bar will be reduced, thereby allowing the bar to pick up more of the wax. 2 Work with a small area at a time. You should use the clay bar on an area that is no bigger than 2x2 feet (61x61 centimeters). This way, you can focus on each area more thoroughly, leading to more even removal. 3 Spray clay lubricant directly on the surface. Some clay bars come with clay lubricant, but sometimes, you may need to purchase it separately. A clay lubricant creates a smooth surface for the clay bar to pass over, making it easier for the clay to glide along the surface of the car without leaving pieces behind.[3] The lubricant should be misted onto the paint evenly. 4 Slide the clay bar along the moistened area. Wipe from side to side or top to bottom, but apply a gentle pressure either way, allowing the clay to do the majority of the work. You may actually be able to hear the clay picking up wax and various contaminants. The clay bar will resist at first, but this is normal and acceptable as long as no clay is being left behind. Continue sweeping the area until the clay bar no longer sticks. The wax is completely removed once the clay bar can slide across the surface without any resistance. 5 Use additional clay lubricant to remove clay residue. If any clay pieces did break off and stick to the paint, spraying them with clay lubricant should make it easier to wipe them away.[4] 6 Tidy the area with a microfiber towel. Remove any excess lubricant and clay particles with a clean terry cloth rag. 7 Repeat the process only if necessary. Lightly rub the paint with your fingers. If it feels smooth, the clay bar did its job. If not, you may need to repeat the process once more, focusing on any areas that still feel rough. 8 Clean the entire car in the same manner. Continue working in 2x2 feet (61x61 centimeters) sections until all the wax has been stripped.

Unprotected paint and trim can quickly discolor, fade, wear off, or otherwise get damaged. Sealants and wax are the best way to ensure a long-lasting finish. Warnings Do not use dishwashing detergent on your car. While it is true that the detergent will likely be able to remove any old wax on your car, it is not generally good to use on your car. These soaps have a high pH, which means that they dry out the surface of anything they touch. This is great at removing grease and wax, but unfortunately, it will also wear away the rubber and plastic surfaces on your car, as well, making them fade a little with each use.

Whether you plan on keeping it or selling it, your car will look cleaner (and be worth more) without the rust, so don\u0027t hesitate to take immediate action. Remove the rust spots and give the car fresh coat of paint as early as possible to stop widespread rust damage before the spot has a chance to spread. Ad Steps Method 1 Buffing and Re-painting Rust Spots 1 Take basic safety precautions. This method involves using a sander and a grinder — two powerful electric tools that can kick fine rust and paint dust into the air. To avoid injury and protect yourself from these airborne particles, be sure to wear gloves, safety glasses and especially a dust mask to keep the rust and paint particles out of your lungs. For heavy-duty jobs, consider using a respirator rather than a simple dust mask. 2 Mask any spots that you don\u0027t want to get dusty. As noted above, this job puts rust and paint particles in the air. If you\u0027re not careful, these can settle on your car, giving it a \"dirty\" appearance that can be hard to get off. To avoid this, \"mask\" the parts of your car that you\u0027re not working on (that is, cover them with tape and masking paper.) Use a tarp sealed with painter\u0027s tape under the car to define your work area and protect the floor. Masking the car off is a delicate art. Do not use newspaper, as paint spray can leak through it and leave unsightly specks. Instead, use real masking paper, which is less porous and won\u0027t let paint through. Also, be sure to tape every single edge of your masking paper down. Don\u0027t just use a few small pieces of tape to get it to stay in place — paint can (and will) work its way under any loose edges. 3 Try to mask along the existing panel lines. In general, you don\u0027t want your masking to stop in the middle of a panel, or you will be left with sharp lines where your new paint ends and the old paint begins. These lines do not go away with any amount of buffing or addition of clear coat layers, so practice prevention by masking the car correctly in the first place, stopping at the panel lines around your rust spots and going no farther inward. If you\u0027re experienced with auto painting, you might alternatively try stopping your masking a few panels back from your rust spot. If you know how to gradually blend paint, which is done when spraying, you can use this tactic to make it so that there isn\u0027t a drastic color difference between one panel and the next. 4 Remove the paint around the rust with a dual action (DA) sander. A DA sander gives you control over the speed of the sander while removing the paint. Start with 80 grit and work your way up to 150 grit. Use the DA sander with (80-150 grit) to take off both the primer and paint, as well as any light rust that hasn\u0027t fused with the metal, and level the surface between the painted surface and the unpainted area. After you\u0027re done, feel with your (gloved) fingers — you should now have a smooth surface. 5 Switch to a metal grinding wheel. Next, use a metal grinder to remove any thick rust buildups and expose any pits. When using the wheel, go slowly, because these tools can do a lot of damage to the car\u0027s body if used incorrectly. Once the grinding is done, apply rust removing acid to the area to remove the microscopic particles of rust that remain. For this job, phosphoric acid is usually best and can be bought at most auto parts stores. If you want, use a hole spot filler or a body filler like Bondo to even out some of the dents and fill the space where the paint is gone. Finish application of your filler by sanding by hand (using 120 grit sandpaper) to get a nice smooth metal surface. See below for more extensive information on using fillers. 6 Prepare the spot for priming. Purchase primer that is ideal for painting on bare metal and an auto spray that matches the color of your car. Both of these supplies can be found at an auto supply store. Primers may vary, so follow the instructions provided with your primer or talk to an expert at the auto store for definitive information. Typically, what you will need to do to prepare is: Wipe the area with mineral spirits or paint thinner. Tape newspaper on all surrounding areas within three feet. 7 Apply thin, even coats of primer. Spray three coats of primer, waiting a few minutes between coats to allow each one to apply. Don\u0027t over-apply — there shouldn\u0027t be so much primer in any one coat that it drips or runs. For most primers, you\u0027ll need to allow the fresh coat to dry overnight (at least 12 hours). 8 Sand with 400 grit wet sandpaper. This abrasive is specifically made for sanding between paint coats to smooth the surface and degloss so the paint bonds properly. Keep a bucket of water handy to rinse the sandpaper frequently so that it does not get fouled with paint. To finish, wash the painted area with a light soap and water mix. 9 Spray a thin coat of paint. Use thin coats of paint and let each coat \"rest\" for a minute or two between applications so as not to let the paint run or sag. Use as many coats of paint over the primer as you need in order to achieve a nice color and finish. Let the paint set at least 24 hours before pulling off the tape. Be patient — if the paint still feels tacky, you may need more time. 10 Buff the edges of the new paint so that it blends with the old paint. If necessary, apply a clear coat to match of the finish on the rest of the car. Finally, allow the paint to cure for 48 hours. 11 Wash and polish the car. Congratulations! Your car is now rust-free and ready to ride. As a precaution, never wax fresh paint within 30 days of painting — the scrubbing, buffing action can pull fresh paint off. Method 2 Using \"Filler Patches\" 1 Grind rust down to \"fresh steel.\" This method is slightly different than the one above, but works by the same basic principles and should work especially well for rust spots that have caused holes or pitting. To start, use a metal grinder to remove all of the rust. You want to grind to the point where you have \"fresh\" (un-rusted) steel all around where the rust spot was, even if this leaves you with a hole. Getting rid of all of the rust is crucial — if you miss even a small fleck of rust, it can corrode underneath your car\u0027s paint over time and lead to another rust spot. Keep in mind, that, because you\u0027re using a grinder, all of the safety precautions at the beginning of the page apply for this method as well. That means wearing gloves, safety glasses and especially a dust mask to keep the rust and paint particles out of your lungs. 2 Cover the hole with a non-rusting filler. Next, you\u0027ll want to apply a filler over your former rust spot. You can buy commercial fillers (like Bondo) at most auto stores for fairly cheap. For larger holes, however, you may need to improvise. In this case, you need something flat and fairly durable that paint can bind to and that won\u0027t rust to patch the hole with. Fix this object in place with a coat of commercial filler and allow it to dry. Believe it or not, cut-up beer or soda cans work well for hole-patching purposes. The aluminum in these cans is naturally corrosion-resistant and many modern cans are coated with a thin protective layer anyway.[1] Another good choice is thin sheets of hard plastic. 3 Use sandpaper to level. Next, use sandpaper to create a smooth, even surface between your new \"patch\" and the actual body of the car. This can be a long, tedious process — as you sand, you\u0027ll probably find that you need to add additional filler and let it dry periodically as you sand away the existing filler. The process thus becomes something along these lines: Filler, grind, filler, grind, filler, grind... (and so on). Start grinding with a rough (low grit) sandpaper to smooth out big bumps, then gradually transition to a medium and finally a fine (high grit) sandpaper for a perfectly smooth finish. Slow, steady, hand-sanding is best for this process — mechanical grinders can tear your patch away. 4 Mask around your work area. Next, you need to apply a fresh coating to your newly-repaired rust spot. To prepare for this, you\u0027ll need to mask most of your car to protect it from primer paint, and other airborne particles. Don\u0027t forget your windows and tires. Try to have the edges of your masking aligned with existing seams in the body of the car to hide minor differences between your new paint and the old paint (unless you\u0027re experienced enough to produce a smooth blend). 5 Apply primer, then paint. Apply a few thin coats of primer, allowing each coat a minute or two to adhere before you reapply on top of it. Let the primer dry overnight, then, after about 12 hours, give it a sanding with wet 400 grit sandpaper so that the paint can adhere properly. When you\u0027re ready, apply your paint on top, using a similar \"spray one thin coat at a time and let it dry\" strategy as you used for the primer. You may want to buff out the edges of your paint and/or cover with a clear coat layer so that this section matches the finish on the rest of your car. Obviously, it\u0027s important to pick a paint that matches your car\u0027s current finish. There is a specific paint color code for each vehicle that can be found on a sticker somewhere in the vehicle. This information is needed in order to match the color up. Most auto paint shops will be more than happy to help you with this. Keep in mind, however, that the paint on older cars can gradually discolor over time.

Ask it here: Submit Video The Rust Repair Process Explained... Tips Alternative to these lengthy processes are Rust converters, those are primers designed to be applied directly to a rusty surface. Unlike the standard scrape, prime, and paint regime, the user does not have to bring the surface down to bare metal. There are two primary components in a rust converter: a tannin and an organic polymer. The organic polymer provides a protective primer layer.The tannin reacts with the iron oxide, converting it to iron tannate, a stable blue/black corrosion product. If the car has significant rust that covers a large area of the body, you may want to leave it to the professionals. Rust converter from a non-spray bottle is excellent for small chips, even if they have not yet begun to rust. Pour out a little in a paper cup (that portion goes bad promptly after being contaminated by bits of rust and the excess must be thrown away). Dab it on up to the edges of good paint with a toothpick. Wait several hours for it to finish reacting and dry before doing anything else to the car (it can be driven once it is dried enough not to run) It leaves a dull black coating that looks like a little tar spot and is generally not noticeable against a medium or dark or metallic color. Touch-up paint will stick to it. If the rust spots are on or around the fender, it may be useful to jack the car safely with a chock behind one of the wheels. Pull off the wheel and unscrew the plastic protecting the wheel well. Doing so will give you a chance to pound out any dents from the inside, and will also allow more room for grinding and painting. Warnings Propellants have explosive properties, so do not allow any sparks or flames, including lit cigarettes, near the work area during the entire rust removal process. Wear gloves, safety glasses and a dust mask to prevent rust and paint dust from irritating or injuring you. If using phosphoric acid BE SURE TO READ AND FOLLOW instructions on the product packaging.

Therefore use a soap like a dish soap that will strip the wax and grease off of the panel being repaired. 2 Wipe the repair area with wax and grease remover to assure that all traces of contaminates are removed. 3 The dent must be metal for the stud welder gun to make contact. Therefore, remove the paint coating by grinding or sanding the surface to metal. 4 Weld the stud nails to the surface that needs to be pulled out. Start by pulling what happened last in the accident (indirect damage) and work towards what happened first in the accident (direct damage). 5 As you are pulling out on the lows, tap the highs with a body hammer. This will relax the metal and allow it to roll back to the desired shape. 6 Pull the damage to the desired shape, remove studs by cutting and grind them smooth. Now you\u0027re ready to apply body filler to the repair area.

It\u0027s easy to repair these problems even if rust has caused big holes. Ad Steps 1 When you discover this type of hole caused by rust, you firstly have to remove all the rust that you can remove as if it can seem that you will never reach the end of the rust. It’s important to reach healthy body to make a lasting repair. 2 When you have removed all rust, paint the border of the hole with a rust converter. That will change the rust that you have been unable to remove into iron. Let dry one hour and wash the all body to stop the chemical reaction. 3 Let the body dry and apply fiber glass on the hole using gloves (the resin is adhesive). Put as many layers of fiber glass as it’s necessary to obtain a resistant result. Between each layer, let the resin dry and sand the result before apply an another layer. 4 In order to get a good result, apply a thin layer of putty on the fiber glass that will fill in little holes caused by fiber glass. Wait two hours and sand it using a sandpaper until smooth. 5 Apply a layer of primer that will give a neutral color to your body and sand it. 6 Apply a duck of the same color that the still body of your car using a spray gun. When you paint the final layer, make sure the temperature is high, it would be easier for you to get a good result especially if you do that for the first time.

Warnings NEVER use a \"tow rope\" in place of a \"recovery strap\" for recovery work. A \"tow rope\" has metal hooks on the ends, and is designed to pull a disabled vehicle on flat ground. A \"recovery strap\" has no metal hooks; instead, the ends of the strap are formed into loops. A recovery strap is designed to extricate a vehicle mired in mud, sand, snow, or rough terrain. When used in a recovery situation, the open hooks on the tow rope may break under extreme tension. Broken hooks have been known to rebound with enough force to break through a windshield, travel through the passenger compartment, and break through the rear window. Lay a heavy blanket across a tow rope to slow it down if the rope breaks. Use common sense, do not use tow line if line is beyond repair. Take care when cutting with sharp blades. Consider why your first rope broke in the first place. If the rope snapped under pressure, the rope is now so stressed and damaged that it should be retired. If on the other hand the rope broke because it was sliced accidentally over a sharp edge, the rope may be strong enough to keep using. Use a repaired tow rope only in an emergency. Always replace a broken rope when possible. Use a repaired tow rope at your own risk. Some insurance companies will not cover damages caused when using any tow rope. Beware. Recovering a stuck vehicle is very different from towing a vehicle that is not stuck. The forces exerted on the rope are much more severe. Ropes and their connection points have been known to break loose and fly through windshields, injuring vehicle occupants and bystanders. Many states have laws regarding what roads you can tow a vehicle on and for how far.

A quick and effective method for patching a hole in an exhaust pipe is using a tin can. Exhaust pipe wraps can be ripped apart by exhaust pressure. By wrapping a tin can around the hole in an exhaust pipe, it creates a seal that lasts without the cost of labor and new parts. Ad Steps Part 1 Properly Jacking Up Your Vehicle 1 Ensure your vehicle jack and jack stands are in proper working order and have the capability of lifting your vehicle prior to jacking up vehicle. 2 Find the jack point on your vehicle If you cannot locate the jack point, use the frame of the vehicle or a solid component of the sub-frame. 3 Use jack to lift the vehicle high enough to be able to work underneath Be cautious. Vehicle may shift if jack is on wheels and ground is not level 4 Place jack stands underneath vehicle at the frame or solid parts of the sub-frame. 5 Release pressure from the jack and place most of the vehicle weight onto the jack stands. Once weight is placed on the jack stands, start to pump the jack until it begins to raise the vehicle again. Do this to have 3 points of contact on the vehicle to make it as stable as possible. 6 Remove handle from jack if possible and set off to the side. Part 2 Preparing Materials and Exhaust Pipe 1 Obtain a tin can. The best tin can to use is a soup can about 4 inches in diameter. 2 Use tin snips or heavy duty scissors to cut the can up the side and to cut the bottom off the can Be very careful cutting the can, the edges are extremely sharp. Wear thick gloves. 3 Set cut can off to the side where it won’t be in the way. 4 Use wire brush to brush off any debris that will hinder the can’s seal against exhaust pipe. Safety glasses are recommended for this step due being under the exhaust pipe you are cleaning. Part 3 Wrapping the Can Around the Exhaust Pipe 1 Form can to the shape of the exhaust pipe over the hole, and where the two edges will overlap. 2 Unscrew completely 5 #28 hose clamps. 3 Place all 5 of the clamps equally over the can. 4 Begin to screw the clamp on one of the ends until the clamp can no longer move. 5 Begin to screw the next clamp until the clamp can no longer move. Continue this until all clamps can not move. 6 Return to the first clamp and tighten until the clamp cannot be tightened anymore. Continue this step for the remainder of the clamps. When clamps are completely tightened, the screw may skip and loosen depending on the diameter of the exhaust pipe. If this occurs tighten clamp again to a point it will not skip and loosen again. 7 Start the vehicle to ensure the exhaust leak has been fixed. If the exhaust leak is still present, recheck the clamps to ensure all are tight and ensure the can is completely covering the hole in the exhaust pipe. Part 4 Lowering The Vehicle 1 Raise the car jack to where the vehicle is lifted off the jack stands. 2 Remove the jack stands from under the vehicle. 3 Slowly lower the vehicle back onto the tires. 4 Remove the car jack from under the vehicle.

Ad Steps 1 Clean the area. All grease, wax, and oil must be removed from the affected area. If the area is not perfectly clean, the repair may fail quickly, or the underlying metal could start to rust beneath the new paint. 2 Apply touch-up paint in layers. Build-up several thin layers of paint finish. Professional paint shops allow each coat of touch-up paint to cure overnight before applying the next. Although time-consuming, this makes for a better repair. 3 Sand new paint level with existing finish. Remove one self-adhesive Sanding Disc from the spool and place it on the Fingertip sanding Spool. Dampen the sanding disc with water. Using a wet sponge, wet the repair area and add a drop of Paint Polish to make a 50/50 mix of polish and water. Sand the repair area by rotating the spool between your thumb and forefinger. Try to sand as small an area as possible, and use just enough pressure to smooth the area. Keep sanding until the touch-up paint is level with the surrounding paint. 4 Buff out the repair with the buffing pad. Attach the Velcro Backup Pad to an electric drill or low-speed (2,000 RPM or less) polisher. Put a \"dime-sized\" spot of Paint Polish on the repair area and turn the drill polisher on. Move the drill over the area in slow, circular motions, using medium pressure for about 10 seconds. Keep the drill running and release some pressure, continuing to polish for about another 2 or three seconds to get maximum gloss. 5 Clean and Wax. Clean the area with water and a damp cloth.

If you\u0027ve got a little elbow grease to spare, this guide will give you some tips for removing rust from your car to prevent further damage. Ad Steps 1 Wash the area around the rust spot. This ensures that there is no additional grease, dirt, or grit to further damage your car\u0027s finish. Use soap to break up grease that is not water soluble. 2 Dry the area to be repaired. 3 With masking tape, tape off the area surrounding the rust. This will help prevent debris from getting onto your existing paint, and also helps protect the paint from overzealous sanding. 4 With a strip of dry sandpaper or a sanding sponge, rub the rusted area. If you\u0027re using sandpaper, push only with your index finger. If you\u0027re using a sanding sponge, or block, then only use a corner. Use moderate and controlled pressure. The goal is to remove the rust, not damage the metal underneath. 5 Keep sanding until all of the rust is gone. Don\u0027t sand away metal or paint unless it is necessary to remove the rust. 6 When the rust has been removed, blow away any excess, and wipe off with a cloth dampened with denatured alcohol to remove little bits of rust, paint, dust, sweat, blood, etc. 7 Examine the area where the rust once was. If you still see rust, repeat sanding and wiping until the rust is gone. If you wind up with uneven spots or even holes in your metal, consider applying auto body putty to even out the area. Let the putty dry. Sand until smooth and the entire area is even. 8 Remove the tape and wipe off with a cloth dampened with denatured alcohol again. 9 Coat the sanded area with primer. Exposed bare metal will only rust again, so don\u0027t skip this step or you\u0027ll be back where you started in a few weeks. 10 Once the primer dries, your repair is complete.

Don\u0027t use lots of force sanding, and don\u0027t use an air-powered sander or rough grades of sandpaper unless the rust is really bad. If it is that bad, you might consider saving time and just replacing body parts with some from a junkyard. Consider the quality of your tools. If you care what the finished product looks like, expensive body putty is well worth the price. If you\u0027re not going to bother painting it once the damaging rust is stopped, then cheap primer will probably get you by for awhile. Rust occurs because air is in contact with bare metal. Rain and salt make a bad situation worse. When you see rust, it is a good sign that the protective layer of paint has been compromised. You might consider having your car repainted if you\u0027re noticing rust pop up in multiple places. If rust has eaten through the metal then a more expensive and extensive repair is needed to remove the rust. Warnings Wear eye protection while sanding. Rust flakes hurt, and can damage more than just your paint. Make sure the area has adequate ventilation when priming or applying putty. Insects, dust and weather conditions can be avoided by parking your car inside for the work, but you don\u0027t want to be overcome by fumes. Wear a mask or respirator.

For some models workshop manuals or workshop videos can be attained from 3rd party Repair companies. This will make the job much easier. Ad Steps 1 Be safe first. Be sure the engine is cool to touch. Many engine compartments are very crowded and it may be difficult to see the parts, screws and nuts, and accessing, reaching or even touching the parts, nuts and bolts is often tricky. ~ Causing an electrical short can ruin the cars computerized systems, relays and fuses. ~ Battery acid, hot fluids, and oil can each burn you, etc. ~ Mashed fingers, skinned knuckles, slips and misalignments are problematic. ~ Working under cars and in a street or parking lot are very dangerous. ~ Understand that \"lefty-loosey\" (means turn toward the left so that counter-clockwise is usually to loosen and remove bolts) and \"righty-tighty\" (right meaning clockwise is usually to tighten) though that direction of turning the tool is helpful. ~ You need to understand that when the nut/screw head is viewed from the opposite end that reverses that direction. Be sure of avoiding confusion about that direction when you are bending over looking down to reach a bolt that is away from your view, that is opposed to your usual view, or when you are looking up from underneath the car at a bolt/nut and needing to reach the head that is opposite from your view, etc. So think about it and go slow. 2 Be sure of the correct process and sequence of loosening and tightening of nuts and bolts which can be very important to keep from warping/ruining parts. ~ Under tightening can cause leaks and failures (vibrating loose and falling off). ~ Over tightening of screws and bolts can strip, or break them off and be very difficult to extract the embedded broken off screw. 3 Avoid using the wrong tool, loose or improper tool slipping off, or wrong size screwdriver can all ruin screws and nut/bolt heads before you get some of the hardest ones to access loose. You might have to use tricks to get them out (a punch or chisel, hacksaw, knife or drill may be needed occasionally, but can and do damage the screws and other parts). So \"get help\" for hard situations. 4 Search for videos and discussions online about a problem that you are thinking about tackling or in the middle of doing. Some videos and discussions are very good. You may find several on some topics or little or nothing on some others. 5 Get a \"Haynes\" manual (which is for less experienced users) from the parts store; even a pro uses a manual to perform repairs. Avoid the dealer service/repair manuals which are usually for experienced mechanics, are not easy to understand, are not detailed and call for use of special numbered tools (often unnecessary). While you may find a manual at the library, these manuals need to be exactly specific to your vehicle, which can make that difficult, and they are so indispensable, it is best to buy one. 6 Familiarize yourself briefly with the complete layout of the manual. They are generally broken up into sections that each encompass a system on your vehicle, i.e. the section about \"Chassis Electrical\", \"Trouble-Shooting\" (by section, check it out), \"Suspension\" (shocks are not bad, but struts are tricky and complicated), etc., and \"Maintenance\" - general upkeep; see the main table of contents and indexes (at the beginning of each section, and an index at the back). 7 Keep records of \"Scheduled Maintenance\" under your warranty which must be proven by receipts and records such as a log furnished by the dealer or the warranty provider. 8 Realize that the electrical section for fuses/fuse boxes (trickier than you might think) are often very poorly labeled, charts are poor, differ by year and by model, and are nearly illegible (hard to read). ~ Remove only \"one\" clear plastic fuse at a time and check by seeing if it is burned out \"one by one\" to keep from mixing them up. Replace or put it back before you look at the next one. ~ There are usually some special, large fuses and relays in a fuse box in the engine compartment or scattered here and there and inline fuse links (in wiring), but the usual fuse boxes for owner/operator access are below the instrument panel or on the \"kickpanel\" near the driver. Some pickups, vans, and trucks have fuse boxes in odd locations compared to where they are located in cars. You might find a fuse panel in the glove box or by unscrewing a cover in the dashboard/near the instrument panel. 9 Start with small and simple: Repairing your vehicle assumes that you know what\u0027s wrong with it. This is often the most difficult part of a vehicle repair, as the repair itself is covered step-by-step in the manual. Diagnosing can be quite tricky, and must be done correctly to avoid \"throwing parts at it\", or making an incorrect (and probably expensive) repair. While there are \"logic trees/troubleshooting charts\" in the manual to test some specific parts, what about when you don\u0027t know which part is bad? Caution: to replace a set of sparkplug-cables or the spark plugs \"only remove one\" and replace that one, and then the next one -- to avoid getting the cables out of sequence which is very likely and would cause firing out of order which could damage the engine. 10 Diagnose the problem. This is where the parts store guy becomes your friend. These guys are often hired for their knowledge; a correct diagnosis by them equals a parts sale. They have a diagnostic code reader that they may attach and read for you (hoping to sell parts) or one that you can borrow for free (with a deposit) -- that\u0027s right, the same service you have been paying $60-$90 for at your repair shop can be done by the parts people or you for nothing. ~ They can also run diagnostics on your de-installed parts such as starter, battery, alternator, etc. If you don\u0027t click with the first parts guy you talk to, shop around, as you are going to find one you do like to work with, and probably follow him around as he changes parts store jobs in your town. 11 Gather tools and supplies needed for the job. Nothing is more of a pain than to be buried in the engine compartment up to your elbows when you realize you don\u0027t have a new (insert cheap but vital tool here). Some back and forth to the store is inevitable, even when you have become comfortable doing this; it helps to remember that you are going to get something that you will own when you are finished with this specific repair, in the case of needing, say, a small specialty tool, and various metric versus customary (English fraction of inch measures) tools. ~ \"Rent to own\" larger more expensive specialty tools at auto parts stores (But, actually you buy it and get a refund \"only if\" you bring it back with the receipt, and the tool is in \"new condition\", within 48 hours for example). 12 Prepare the area. Block wheels to prevent rolling. If you are going to be leaking fluids, put down a drop cloth. If you will need to get under the car, a flattened, large cardboard box or a scrap of carpet pad can make all the difference for comfort when you are lying on the ground and for cleanliness. ~ Caution: Always use \"jack stands\" to help maintain the security and safety of the jack when you must raise the vehicle. ~ Drive up ramps are quite useful, but some very low cars can \"not\" work with the ramps. ~ Driving two wheels onto a curb may work in a pinch to help raise one side or an end of a vehicle. 13 Follow the manual order and method instructions. It can be tempting to get in a hurry, and think that some steps seem irrelevant -- until later. 14 Develop a system for placing parts that you had to remove to just get to the defective part in such a way that they will be easier to reassemble, replace properly, such as setting a bracket down correctly oriented, with it\u0027s accompanying hardware placed right by where it goes, rather than all jumbled in a pile. A good method will also incorporate reversing the order of removal to put it together again. ~ Caution: A manual instruction such as \"now replace the peripheral flange bracket\" is useless to you, if you can\u0027t remember how the bracket came off -- and while the manual is helpful, the pictures often are not very clear and are not labeled or explained well. 15 Take pictures. Label parts with tape and names and numbering, etc. Cell phone pictures are small, and it\u0027s more helpful if you are able to upload them to your PC when needed; but even a small picture, taken from very close to show a vital detail, can potentially save you hours. 16 Draw a picture before dis-assembly -- or if you have to, get someone else to draw pictures and work on labeling them with you. 17 Use nail polish, or a number of clear scratches to mark the spot for alignment of parts. If, as you are removing a part, you find yourself asking, \"I wonder how I\u0027ll remember if that goes this way, there, or there?\", a dot of nail polish, after a quick wipe off, can tell you. Nail polish applied to two touching/matching parts for gaskets, etc. can save you of the need to re-calibrate, re-time, and re-adjust after the repair is completed -- you just re-align the polish stroke or scratches. 18 Realize that each repair is a relearning or learning process. The first time you \"R\"emove \u0026 \"R\"eplace an alternator, it might be frustrating. ~ Take breaks if needed. When you are finished, realize that your next alternator \"R\u0026R\" on this or a similar model will happen in about 1/3 the time -- and any alternator R\u0026R, even on a truck, is now within your reach. 19 Study each problem thoroughly before beginning: If you are in any doubt as to your ability to perform a needed repair, read the manual step-by-step R\u0026R for that repair, re-read it; it will give you a pretty good idea whether you\u0027re up to it or not.

It isn\u0027t at all uncommon to have a car in for a completely unnecessary repair because the owner didn\u0027t bother to open the hood and take a quick look around. Although it\u0027s less common now, cars vibrate, nuts loosen, debris/leaves, grass and dust collect and rodents/mice nick or chew off wires, etc. Go check out \"Auto Maintenance for Dummies\", and read it before you begin your first repair. Protect hands: first wash hands and then apply Vaseline (essentially \"invisible gloves\"), or buy surgical latex, vinyl or nitrile gloves, if you want normal hands when you\u0027re done. The parts store has hand cleaner and protection, but embedded dirty grease in your skin, creases and cuticles is very difficult to remove; like oil based paint; stains may have to be \"worn-off\". Warnings Jacks can wobble and fall, embed in the pavement or earth, or slip off, slide, break, bend, fold... very dangerous. Never work under a car with a jack \"without a jack-stand\" used properly in case of jack problems. Exercise care when working around a hot car parts, hot oil, and especially with the hot cooling system, which may have steam pressure and can cause scalding injuries. Things You\u0027ll Need A Haynes manual. for anything other than the most basic maintenance, it is a must. A tool kit. Large discount stores, home building centers and such have better prices on good tools than auto parts. Luckily this will vary depending upon how involved you plan to get in your car repair, and can be added to as needed, so start with the basics -- and then later add (when needed) sets of larger and deeper sockets, a breakover wrench, some \"star\" and \"torx / t\" drivers, punches, chisels, etc. A shade tree or approved area (cities and apartments may have time rules and even tow away disabled/disassembled cars if not finished quickly).

Before you spend a lot of money, try this --- remove your gas cap and retighten it, a loose or bad seal on the gas cap can set an evap code in your cars ECM or ECU causing a check engine or service engine soon light to come on. 2 Loosen the negative terminal on your battery for 2 or 3 minutes, then reconnect your battery term. This will reset your cars ECM or PCM, if there is not a serious problem then the check engine or service engine light will stay off. If the light comes back on, you have other problems, the next most common cause is a clogged or inop e.g.r valve. 3 You can also reset your ECM/ECU after installing performance parts for it to learn the new parts otherwise they will not perform 100% 4 Another way too reset is open the engine fuse box and remove the ecm/ecu fuse sometimes its the main fuse. After resetting start car/truck and let idle only do not touch anything during a 10 minute idle period . 5 Engine Control Unit, or ECU. Actually with the introduction of OBD-II the name was officially changed to ECM (Engine Control Module). But everyone still knows it as the ECU so let\u0027s just keep calling it that so we all understand what we\u0027re talking about. 6 The ECU\u0027s of today are very sophisticated computer chips that monitor all the data recorded by the various sensors in the engine. Not only do they monitor the engine, they can also make changes based on the data that was recorded to keep the engine running at it\u0027s maximum possible efficiency. When a modification is done on one of our cars, the program that the ECU was running ends up conflicting with what is now going on in the engine. This can cause problems especially at idle when the engine hangs in the dangerously low RPMs or just stalls out. So instead of waiting for the ECU to adjust itself, you might need to reset it manually. 7 NOTE: I am not saying this is the only way to reset the ECU. I understand there are many other ways but I have found this way to be easiest and, most importantly, the safest. consult your manual for proper fuse locations. If you still have your stock radio, you will need the security code given to you by your dealer or (hopefully) by the person who sold you the car. 8 Make sure the car has already been warmed up to normal operating temperature and is turned off. Pop the hood and find the fuse box. It will be on the passenger side next to the battery as you can see in the first picture. Remove the lid and pull out both fuses as pictured in the second picture. 9 Leave the fuses out for a few minutes to allow all the old data to be wiped out. Plug the fuses back in. It doesn\u0027t matter if you plug them in upside down or whatever they don\u0027t have any polarity so just make sure you plug the right fuse in the right place and you\u0027re all good. Make sure to replace the fuse box cover as well. 10 Start up the car and let it idle for about 10 minutes. Don\u0027t hit the gas pedal during this time. This time allows your ECU to make new data based on how much air it sees coming into. Use this time to reset your radio stations and clock. After 10 minutes is up, turn the car off. 11 That\u0027s it, you\u0027re done. Once you start the car up again, the ECU should be aware of the changes to the motor. Have fun!

Ad Steps 1 Get a pulley puller from your local auto parts store BEFORE you start. Get a couple bottles of Power Steering fluid. Some newer Fords recommend using Mercon V Transmission Fluid in the Power Steering System, so check with your auto parts salesman while there. 2 Disconnect battery. Remove wire connector on the rear of the alternator. Pull back the rubber cover on the top of the alternator and remove the small screw that hold the connector on. 3 Drain the power steering fluid with a siphon type pump. 4 Remove the serpentine belt. There is a cool way to do this. Look for the tensioner in the upper rear area of the engine compartment. Put a 15mm wrench on the lower bolt and pull it towards the front of the van. As the tension is reduced pull the belt off with your free hand. 5 Remove the power steering pump pulley using the puller. 6 If none is at hand, you may remove the whole unit without removing the pulley: Get the pump free removing everything (alternator, fluid lines) leaving only the three bolts. Remove the accessible two bolts. The lower one can only be pulled out when the pump is loose and can be tilted. Looking at the pulley wheel, the third one hides behind its rim at 6-o\u0027clock. Select a close-fitting wrench (not to damage the flanks of the head when using force) and slip it (working by feeling) in direction from 6 to 12 o-clock over the head. Once having the feeling how and where it is sitting, readjust to an 8 -o-clock position approximately, making sure that turning between 8 to 6 you will not press anything other than the head of the bolt. Slowly pull from 8 to 6 until it clicks, which should mean that the bolt comes free. Continue to unscrew till it is out 1/4 (5mm) or so, NOT pressing the pulley wheel, as the head will stay under it. Cautiously try to pull the unit free over the bracket (to the water pump) and let it rest there, so you are able to move it sideways. Now continue to unscrew the bolt moving the unit along until all comes free (this bolt will be trapped under the pulley). Be aware that not paying attention to forces, position and so on may easily cause damage. 7 Remove the pump lines. Fluid will probably go all over. Once the pulley is off loosen the 3 bolts that hold the power steering pump to the assembly to that contains the alternator and the power steering pump. The three bolts are easy to find. Once those 3 are loose look for the other 3 bolts that hold the assembly to the engine block. Remove these 3 completely. When the bolts are out the entire assembly containing the alternator and power steering pump can be lifted up and laid over to the left. Remove the 3 power steering pump bolts and slide it out to the right. 8 Put the new pump in place. Check the bolts for wear. Replace if necessary. 9 Hand tighten the bolts to the pump. Lift the assembly and slide it back into place. It may need some convincing to get into place. Slide the 3 bolts back in place. Tighten to spec. Tighten up the pump bolts. Put the pulley back on using the proper tool. 10 Put the main pump line back in place with a new washer. At this point I highly recommend flushing the system. 11 Reconnect the bottom hose. This is a tight squeeze. I had to remove the valve cover to get my fingers into the space. 12 Replace the serpentine belt. 13 Add fluid to the reservoir. Reconnect the alternator wiring. When you are certain everything is back in place, have an assistant start the engine. Add fluid to the reservoir if it needs it. Do not put in too much.

The puller must be for pulling power steering pulleys. This puller hooks onto the nubbin at the center of the pulley and uses a bolt to push against the end of the shaft with. Using a puller that attaches to the edges of the pulley may bend the pulley and likely won\u0027t work correctly - moreover there is a risk of damaging the rim it is hooked to, as this is soft material and because of this needs a full contact. It is more likely that you need to remove the whole bracket, there are 3, 15mm bolts, and also the idle pulley (for access one of the bolts). Warnings KEEP ALL TOOLS, LOOSE CLOTHING AND FINGERS AWAY FROM THE SERPENTINE BELT! Do not start the engine without adding fluid! You must closely watch not to cause damage while removing the whole unit.

However, you can save a lot of money by visiting a junkyard and looking for parts there. Ad Steps 1 Determine what part(s) you need, and make a list of them. This is helpful, especially if you have numerous parts to replace. 2 Examine the existing damaged parts on your car to determined how they need to be removed. Some components (such as doors and hoods), only need to be unbolted. Others, such as quarter panels, may need to be chiseled or cut off. Write down measurements for the part you need (dimensions of the part, the size of the bolts that hold it on, etc.). 3 Determine the compatibility of your particular car year and model with other years and models. Many car companies use they same body components for more than one year. For instance, if your car is a \u002796, a door from a \u002798 of the same model may fit or vice versa. Also, remember that some car makes are cross compatible (such as Chevrolet and GM). Determining this will require special research depending on your vehicle. 4 Gather the necessary tools (socket set, chisels, screwdrivers, torches, etc.) Some junkyards ban the use of power tools/torches in their facility, so check with them ahead of time. 5 When you arrive at the junkyard, look for your make and model or a compatible make and model. Some junkyards organize the cars by make/model, others do not. Either way, you are going to have to do a little searching. 6 When you find a compatible junk vehicle, examine the part(s) you want to remove. Check for rust damage, dents, etc. on the used part. Many junkyards will not give you a refund for used parts, so make sure it will work for you before you purchase it. 7 Remove the part(s). The great part about self-service junkyards is that you get to remove the part yourself, which is great practice for when you reinstall it on your personal vehicle. 8 When you get the part(s) home, reinstall them (by means of bolting, welding, etc.). Some body items, like doors and hoods, may require adjustment to get them to align perfectly with the rest of your car.

These components are interconnected with a series of steel tubes and steel reinforced rubber hoses, and the hydraulic oil may eventually begin to leak through these hoses, making it necessary to replace them. It can be a dirty job, but doing it yourself can save considerable expense and time. Ad Steps 1 Locate the problem hose. This may be obvious if the hose has burst, since they typically handle oil at over 2000 PSI pressure, and one that bursts will discharge a large amount of oil in a short time. If the situation is a small leak, though, you will need to observe where the oil is dripping, and follow the wet trail it leads to the source. Never use your hands or body parts to find the leak. Use cardboard, paper or hydraulic leak detection fluid so no oil injection is accrued. A good hydraulic shop stocks leak detection additives that assist on location the leak safely. 2 Assess how many components must be removed to facilitate replacing the damaged hose. Always label the component removed by number and letter so replacement of parts can be reinstalled with ease. This may include housings, guards, clamps, other hoses, hydraulic cylinders, and more. Follow the hose from one end to the other, noting the route you will use to uninstall and reinstall it. Putting a number and letter on the ports and hose ends. 3 Determine if the hydraulic component the hose serves, or any other hydraulic components which must be removed have a live load, or weight on them. If the oil in the system you are disconnecting is under pressure, it may blow out forcefully when the fittings which hold it are loosened, causing oil to be discharged under pressure. Relieve the pressure from these cylinders or components before proceeding. 4 Make sure any attachments which are supported by the hydraulic cylinder the hose operates are lowered to the ground or blocked or chained up. The weight of an attachment can crush a mechanic if it suddenly falls when pressure is relieved in the cylinder that is supporting it. 5 Get the tools you will need to perform the job of removing the hose. The fittings on the each end of the hose will be removed with a wrench, which may vary in size from 9/16 to over 1 1?2 inches (3.8 cm). Many of these fittings are designed to swivel or turn as they operate, so two wrenches will be required to remove each of them. Hold the stationary side of the coupling with one wrench to prevent it from turning, and possibly damaging an O-ring while turning the other to separate the coupling. 6 Remove all clamps and attachments which will interfere with removing the hose. Often, the hydraulic cylinder itself will need to be removed or supported so that fittings can be accessed. Hydraulic cylinders are either bolted directly to the boss or fixture which it operates, or is anchored with a steel pin, such as the one in the illustration. 7 Loosen the fitting that attaches the hydraulic hose to the hydraulic system, either at a coupling, a cylinder, or the valve spool itself. Make sure the fitting turns at the threaded connection, and does not twist any other part. If needed, you may have to hold the fitting the hose is attached to with a separate wrench. 8 Pull the hose off of the equipment when both ends are unfastened. Be aware that some hydraulic oil may leak from either or both connections, and the oil that is remaining in the hose will also dump out, so having a bucket handy to catch this spillage is a good idea. 9 Plug the fittings that remain on the machine to keep debris from getting into the system during the interval the fitting is open. If you do not have oil dripping from the fitting, and do not have a plug with the correct threads on it, you may tie a clean rag around the fitting to protect it, but be careful if rain is in the forecast, since a rag won\u0027t protect the system from being contaminated with water. 10 Wipe excess oil from the hose, and take it to an equipment supply store to have a new one ordered or made. After market manufacturers and OEM dealers supply replacement hoses and fittings which can be assembled while you wait, and are less expensive than ordering an original equipment manufacturer\u0027s product. Make sure the hydraulic shop that makes the hose will clean the hoses inside with a proper cleaning system not just shop air. A proper hydraulic hose shop like ASAP hydraulics will use an ultra clean system and install end caps to make sure no contamination will enter into the system. The end caps will keep the line clean until the line is routed throughout the system and ready to install. 11 Clean all the fittings on the equipment before reinstalling the hose. Make sure there is no dirt in the tubing or fitting which will end up in the hydraulic system when you are finished. 12 Plug the ends of your new hoses with a special cap or a clean rag before routing it through the equipment to where it goes. This will keep dirt and debris from being forced into the hose while installing it. Remove these temporary plugs immediately before installing the fittings where they mate up with their counterparts. 13 Make sure the hose is in the correct location, and it has the proper amount of slack where needed when it is installed, then thread the fittings back on the cylinder or other component where they were removed. Tighten these connections snugly. You may have access to a specification book which recommends a torque to apply to each fitting, but failing this, tighten them as much as you can without risking damaging the seals or stripping the threads which hold them. 14 Replace any clamps, guards, or other components which were removed to accomplish the task. Align any cylinder pins which were removed, and reinstall them, and return any split or snap rings which hold them in place. 15 Check the fluid level in the machine, crank it up, and check for leaks. If you have had a chance to clean all surfaces that were soiled by the initial leak, any leaks that occur now will be much easier to spot. Keep in mind some hydraulic circuits will require bleeding to remove air from the system prior to using the machine. This usually applied to steering and brake systems, but there are other situations where air can become trapped, such as a single action cylinder where the hydraulic supply is at a low point in the cylinder. Reader Questions and Answers Unanswered Questions Show more unanswered questions Add New Question Answered Questions Don\u0027t see your question? Ask it here: Submit Tips The safest method of checking for pin-hole leaks while the system is under pressure is simply using a sheet of paper held near the hoses. The location of the leak will be easily found. Replace hoses that have become cracked, scuff marked which the braided or wires are showing. Never put any body part against or near a hydraulic hose, fitting or tubing since any outside pressure may cause product failure and oil injection. Add this to your part of your regular maintenance, rather than waiting for a catastrophic failure, which may at least cause damage to other parts of the machine, and can even cause operator injury or death. Clean all surfaces that will be accessed during the work if possible to make the job easier and cleaner. Inspect any equipment before using. Standard industry inspections occur daily or at the beginning of each shift. Look for oil leaks, visible damage, or other indications of an unserviceable condition. Make sure you have all the tools you need before beginning. Keep bolts, pins, and lock rings in a container until you reinstall them. Be sure to locate the correct hose for the repair. Hoses are often routed very close together, making it difficult to identify the leaking hose. Mark any components which may be difficult to find the correct replacement location, especially if you are taking off a number of hoses, so these are not reinstalled in the wrong place. Warnings Hydraulic hoses have a steel wire(s) or spiral braiding reinforcing jacket underneath the outer cover, and when these become exposed and abraded, they can cause nasty cuts or abrasions. Hydraulic oils may be flammable, so leaks should be dealt with immediately upon discovery. Hydraulic components can weigh hundreds, or even thousands of pounds, so use care when working on them. Hydraulic oil under pressure can be injected directly into human tissue, causing serious tissue destruction. In particular, injuries to the hand can be deceptively benign appearing due to the small entry site, but all hand injuries require immediate and careful exploration by a hand surgeon due to the multiple tissue planes involved. Make sure hydraulic hose is replaced with an equal or better pressure rating. And if the fluid used is other then an SAE blend of 10 or 20 weight, as phosphate ester or synthetic blend. You must make sure the replacement hose meets your requirements via a pressure or suction line. Things You\u0027ll Need Wrenches and tools for the removal and installation process New hoses Hydraulic oil to replace that which was lost through the leak A bucket to catch oil that leaks out when the hoses are disconnected Safety gloves, glasses, mask, clean rags, oil dry, fire extinguisher, caps or plugs, tape and marker to label parts, shield to cover exhaust system to prevent fire as oil may spill on exhaust.

If necessary, you may want to note and label all the wires as you remove them. 4 Detach the starter from its mounting. Most commonly, 2 to 3 bolts hold the starter to its bracket. If there is extra mounting hardware, like washers or shims, note and label the location of each piece, so you can properly reinstall the starter when you’re finished. 5 Remove the starter from the car. If it’s a tight squeeze, and it often is, remove the support bracket (if there is one) before you get the starter out of the engine bay. Depending on your car, you may have to disconnect or remove adjacent parts before you can get the starter out. Plan ahead and determine the easiest route out of the engine compartment. 6 Put the starter on your work surface and remove the support bracket, if you haven’t already done so. 7 Separate the field coil strap, which is the braided wire, from the solenoid terminal. 8 Loosen and remove all screws and mounting bolts from the solenoid, noting and labeling locations as you go. 9 Take the solenoid from the starter. Work slowly and be careful as you do so as starter components. There may be exposed or loose parts such as the spring and plunger. Note the location of the plunger, spring and any special steps you have to take, so you can repeat them in reverse when installing your new solenoid. 10 Attach the new solenoid to the starter. As mentioned above, take care that the plunger and spring interact with the solenoid as before. Make sure that you situated the spring correctly and that the plunger and starter shift lever interact as before. 11 Reattach the field coil strap and any brackets and reinstall the starter in the car. Then reattach all cables and wires to the starter in their previous locations by referring to your notes, labels or memory. 12 Reconnect your battery to your starter.

The chain inside of the transfer case can stretch over time, creating a popping or rattling sound from under the vehicle. Here I will give very generic notions on how to replace a defective chain so anyone can have an idea of how the procedure is done. I wrote them having single speed units such as the NV125, LWX500, NP126, NP140, ITC, NP149, NP136, etc. They are very common in BMW, Cadillac, Jeeps and other SUVs. Ad Steps 1 Remove of the drive line shaft and any tail cone or seal housing, if applicable. 2 Now with the drained transfer case out of the vehicle (it is possible to work on it with the transfer case still on the vehicle, depending on the space you have to work with), remove all bolts that secure both halves of the unit. 3 Pry the unit open, there are special tools that make this easier. There also are specific spots around the unit designed for prying purposes, they usually look like tabs or small slots in between the halves. 4 Once the first half is out, you should be able to see the chain right away, going around the drive and driven sprockets. On one side, there should be a planetary gear and a ring gear around it. Now in some units, there might be a snap ring securing the sprockets, others like the NV125, the sprockets along with the chain should just slide out, making it very easy to replace the chain. 5 After placing the new chain with the sprockets back into the unit, make sure any component was placed back in its original position, clean the sealing surface of each transfer case half and apply black RTV. 6 Lightly tighten the bolts, and wait about a couple of hours and then do a final tightening so the unit is properly sealed.

Different models may have a different setup. Ad Steps 1 Jack up vehicle and place securely on jackstands. 2 Remove front tires. 3 Remove brake caliper. DO NOT let the caliper hang by the rubber hose. Always either tie it to something that\u0027s not coming off, or find a nice place for it to rest that it won\u0027t drop off. Her it is set on top of the coil spring. 4 Remove both brake pads by pulling them straight out, then up. 5 Remove the dust cover for the wheel bearings by prying the cap off with a screwdriver or other small pry tool. 6 Remove the cotter pin and nut cover from the hub nut. 7 Remove the hub nut. When this nut is removed, the hub assembly will be free to fall off. 8 Pull the hub assembly straight out. The outer wheel bearing and washer will come off with the hub assembly, and will be free to fall. The inner bearing SHOULD stay in the hub assembly, but it may stay on the spindle if your seal is bad. Leave it on and it should come off in the next step. 9 Remove the brake shield but removing the three bolts that hold it on and pull straight out. 10 Remove the outer tie rod from the spindle by removing the cotter pin and nut. Thread the nut back on a few turns to keep it from falling completely off of the spindle initially. Once it\u0027s separated from the spindle, you can take the nut off and lay it out of the way. 11 Once the tie rod is off, the spindle is free to move left and right. Spin it out of the way and have a look at the ball joints. First to come off is the bolt for the pinch joint and camber adapter on the upper ball joint. 12 Remove the cotter pin and nut from the lower ball joint. Same deal as the tie rod end, thread it back on a few turns so it doesn\u0027t fall completely. 13 Give the axle and/or spindle a few taps with a hammer until the ball joints separate from the axle. A ball joint separator might be handy here, but it should fall right out after a few good hits. 14 Remove the nut from the lower ball joint and remove the spindle. 15 Most manuals will tell you that the upper ball joint MUST be pressed out first, but you may not find a way to do so. Remove the lower ball joint first by setting up the ball joint press with a receiver cup bigger than the ball joint on the upper part of the ball joint, and the forcing screw on the bottom part of the ball joint. This image is set up for installing the lower ball joint, so the only thing you would do differently is not having a receiving cup and adapter plate on the bottom (Only the forcing screw needs to be on bottom). Repeat with the exact same setup for the upper ball joint. The forcing screw will actually go through the hole where the lower ball joint was when pressing out the upper ball joint. 16 When installing the ball joints, you have to start with the upper ball joint. Use the setup in the picture for the previous step. 17 Once the ball joints are installed, grease up your new wheel bearing by putting a glob of grease in your hand and working it into the bearing until the grease is packed into all of the bearing. Put the inner bearing into the hub assembly, and then tap the seal into place over the bearing. Ensure that the seal is flush with the hub assembly to confirm proper installation. 18 Now for the phrase that everybody hates: Installation is the reverse of the removal. Just install the nuts back at the proper torque on the ball joints, tie rod ends, and wheel lug nuts.

Recognizable for a knocking sound in the wheel well as you execute a turn, fixing old ball joints is an important part of keeping your vehicle road-safe. You can do it yourself for the price of the parts and the right approach. Ad Steps Part 1 Getting Started 1 Prep the work area. Park on a flat surface and block both rear wheels, front and back. Jack both front wheels off the ground and support the vehicle with jack stands. Chock the back tires to make sure nothing will move anywhere while you\u0027re working. 2 Inspect the ball joints to make sure they need to be replaced. Figure out if your vehicle\u0027s got a strut-style suspension or a control arm, then check the ball joint by either jacking up the control arm near the ball joint to check for wheel play, or by jacking up the car and using a pry-bar to check for wheel play in a strut-style suspension. There should be no space between the ball joint and the point of contact. If you see any space, or the wheel moves considerably, the joint needs to be replaced. 3 Purchase the correct replacement ball joint assembly for your vehicle. Go to the auto parts store and get a replacement part appropriate for your make and model. All you\u0027ve got to know is the type of vehicle and you should be able to use the guidebook in the aisle, or ask for help and they\u0027ll be able to direct you. Typically, a solid ball joint replacement will run about $80 or $90 new. Compared to the several hundred to a thousand dollars they\u0027ll charge at the shop, this can be a very cost-effective DIY project. 4 Remove the wheel and access the ball joint. Depending on the steering assembly, you may also have to move aside the brakes. If so, use a wire to hang the brakes and don’t dangle them by the brake lines. You\u0027ll also need to loosen the mounts holding the control arm or sway bar in place to give you more room to move suspension parts away. If it\u0027s at all possible, try to work around the brake rotor, caliper, and the line without removing the assembly. If you do, you\u0027ll have to bleed the brakes, making this a much bigger job. 5 Soak all the bolts with WD-40 or PB Blaster. The ball joints can be some of the gunkiest components on the entire undercarriage, quite caked with dirt and other road grit, and it can be a bear trying to get the ball joint loose from that build-up. To make it easier on yourself, spray some metal cleaner on all the bolts to try to get them to slip off somewhat more easily.[1] Part 2 Removing the Old Ball Joint 1 Pull the cotter pin and loosen the large castellated nut. The top should look like a crown, or castle, at the bottom. Leave the castellated nut in place, just a few turns in to keep it in a safe place. If you’re working on a McPherson strut suspension remove the “pinch bolt” that clamps the ball joint stud. 2 Pop loose the ball joint. The goal is to try to guide it through the hole in the upper half of the steering knuckle. It can be somewhat difficult because of the extremely tight fit which helps hold the ball joint in place and the road grime built up around the suspension, so you will most likely need to use a hammer and a special tool called a “pickle fork” or tie rod separator to get enough leverage to maneuver.[2] With the wrench, remove the largest nut from the joint, replace with the new nut, and then drive the pickle fork between the control arm and the steering knuckle. You\u0027ll probably have to hammer it, and don\u0027t be afraid to get rough.This will probably ruin the gasket around the ball joint, so make sure you\u0027ve got one to replace it. By putting the castellated nut on before hammering away, you\u0027ll avoid having the ball joint pop completely out and drop onto the floor, or more likely your foot. 3 Remove the allen bolts and slide the control arm free. Loosen bolts or drill out rivets holding the ball joint in place, and slide out the ball joint. Sometimes, it\u0027s helpful to heat particularly corroded components with a torch to try to loosen them. Be careful if you try this. If your auto’s suspension uses pressed-in ball joints, you’ll need to remove the lower control arm and take the assembly to a mechanic with a hydraulic press, who can press the old ball joint out and the new ball joint in. Part 3 Installing the New Joint 1 Guide the new joint through the knuckle hole. Slide the new rubber boot over the ball joint’s stud and guide the new ball joint back up through the steering knuckle hole, where it came from. 2 Bolt the joint into place using the hardware included. It\u0027s not usually advisable to re-use old bolts or rubber boots that covered the old ball joint, which will probably be too corroded if the ball joint wore out. 3 Torque the bolts to the proper specifications. Refer to the manufacturer’s service manual and use a torque wrench to tighten the bolts and castellated nut to specified levels; reinstall the pinch bolt if working on a McPherson strut. Generally, the specs will be about 44 pounds per foot on the screws and around 80 for other bolts. Always defer to the owner\u0027s manual for accurate numbers, however. 4 Screw in the new grease fitting and pump grease into the assembly. If you removed the brake or wheel, reattach them and lower the vehicle back down to test out the action. Bleed the brakes, if necessary. It\u0027s a good opportunity to do any other repairs you might need to do with the brakes, since you\u0027ve got them off. Replacing a ball joint can affect alignment. If a ball joint is worn enough, and the vehicle was previously aligned, it might be wise have the vehicle realigned.

Ad Steps Part 1 Removing the Old Brakes 1 Find a good work area, preferably in a closed in shop. Also, make sure the work area is clean. 2 Make sure the tractor is cleaned before pulling it into the work area. 3 Acquire the proper tools for the job. The following are the tools required: wood wedges, 3 ton floor jack and jack stands, a cherry picker hoist, short chain with hooks, 1/2\" drive impact socket set, 1/2\" drive impact, 1/2\" drive torque wrench, a set of wrenches and a 3/8\" drive socket set with ratchet. 4 With the tractor in the work space, put the wedges between the front axle and the frame. 5 Place the jack on the rear end of the tractor and jack it up until the rear tires are a 1/2\" off the ground. Place the jack stands under the tractor and be careful not to place them under the final drives. The best place to place the jack stands is under the transmission. Once jack stands are in place the tractor can be set down and the jack removed. 6 Remove the wheels from both sides of the tractor. 7 Remove the fenders, fuel tank, and ROPS. Be sure to set them out of the way and start draining the hydraulic oil from the tractor. 8 Remove the linkage for the brakes from the final drives and start unbolting the final drives. Leave two bolts loose in the final drive and wrap it with a chain and hook the cherry picker hoist to it. 9 Wiggle the final drive loose and then remove the two bolts. Once the bolts are removed the final drive can be pulled away from the tractor and set down. 10 Turn the final drive up so the hub for the wheel is on the bottom and the brakes can be accessed. 11 Remove the shaft that connects the final drive to the tractor and set it on a rag in a clean place. 12 Access and pull out the brakes. There should be a metal disc, brake pad, metal disc, brake pad, then the brake piston. A bolt from one of the clips might need to be loosened to remove the metal discs and brakes. 13 Remove the shaft for the linkage from the final drive and remove the seal for it. Part 2 Installing the New Brakes 1  Insert the new seal and the shaft can be reinstalled. 2 Put the new brake pads and metal disc back inside the final drive. Make sure if the clamp was loosened to tighten it back. The shaft that connects the final drive and transmission can be installed in the final drive. 3 Remove the hydraulic filter and install a new one. Also, remove the strainer and either clean or install a new one depending on the condition. 4 With the new filter on and the strainer cleaned, reinstall the final drives. Lift them with the cherry picker. Put a seal maker on the edge of the final drive housing before pushing it back to the tractor. The final drives may need to be wiggled and turned some for them to line up. 5 Start 2 bolts in the housing, one in the top and one in the bottom. Slowly turn the bolts to pull the final drives in to the transmission. 6 Install the rest of the bolts. Use a torque wrench and the proper torquing procedure to tighten the bolts to 75ftlbs. 7 Reinstall the fuel tank, ROPS, and fenders. 8 Put the wheels back on the tractor. Replace the hydraulic oil. 9 Jack the tractor up off the jack stands and lower the tractor back on the ground. 10 With the tractor safely on the ground, adjust each brake pedal separately. Each brake should have about 2 1/2\" of travel and should both have equal amounts of travel. 11 Start and test drive the tractor. Test the brakes and make sure they are working properly. If they aren\u0027t they might have to be adjusted more or something was done wrong in the repair process.

Four bushings hold the subframe/cradle to the uni-body chassis. Bad mounts or bushings cause stress, premature wear and damage of vital engine and transmission parts. The two engine mounts and the transmission mount – also called insulators – on the Concorde are made of rubber (some may be \"gel filled\"), all having a steel skeleton consisting of embedded studs and mounting bolts and nuts. With time, the rubber cracks, breaks-up, gets compacted, misshaped, and the mount can split or become fragmented. This decay causes more and more chaotic engine movement -- shake, wobble, clattering, vibrating, noise, bumping about -- and must be fixed. Here\u0027s your ticket to save several hundreds of dollars. Ad Steps Part 1 Removing the Engine Mounts 1 Choose a level, concrete surface (strong 3/4 inch plywood can make softer surfaces or the ground workable). Set the parking gear and the brake. Block the wheels. Raise the front of the Concorde with a jack(s) and support the car with jack stands. Remove the splash guards under each fender to reveal access to the mounts. 2 Place a full width piece of 2 by 6, or 2x8 inch wood between a jack and the engine oil pan -- but not extending under the subframe. Raise the jack only until it just begins raising the engine a very little, to mainly support the engine, but not to raise the vehicle at all. 3 Loosen, but do not remove the upper nuts that connect the mount to the upper mounting-bracket using a ratchet and socket. (If your mounts have a heat shield between the mount and engine, remove the nut or bolt from the bracket holding the heatshield, using your ratchet and socket. Remove the heatshield.) Keeping the nuts loosely screwed on to just a few bolt threads, on the bolts, keeps the mounts aligned until both are loosened -- retained to this same degree, held on loosely, on each side of the engine. 4 Loosen the lower nuts: But, do not remove them from the bolt attaching them to subframe, through holes in the subframe, using your ratchet, an extension and a socket, for both mounts. 5 The transmission mount: Prepare to remove the third mount much in the same manner as the engine mounts (of a different design) at the rear of the transmission This mount may need to be replaced for backward and forward stability. Part 2 Installing Engine Mounts 1 Remove the mount nuts and replace only one mount at a time: Raising the engine far enough with the jack to get either one of the mounts off, then replace it as follows. 2 Slide the studs on the bottom of the new mount into the holes in the subframe -- and lower the jack a little to seat the engine mounting bracket down lightly onto the stud(s) on the top of the mount, maintaining alignment, so not binding, by tightening nuts and bolts little by little. 3 Install the lower nuts and \"finger tighten\" at the subframe, loosely as before, just by a few threads, to retain the engine positioning. 4 Install the upper nuts and \"finger tighten\", at the engine bracket, as well. Install the heatshield and its retaining bolts, if your vehicle is so equipped (on the 3.5-liter engine, for example). 5 Install the transmission mount by much the same techniques as the engine mounts. 6 Now, lower the engine a little. Snug the nuts and bolts on all both mounts, at first only \"finger tight\". Then snug them all a little. 7 Finally, torque all the mount attaching nuts and bolts to the manufacturers recommended number of foot-pounds with a torque wrench and a socket. The large nuts and bolts might be torqued to about 45 to 50 foot (13.7 to 15.2 m) pounds. The smaller bolts on the transmission mount are torqued less, perhaps to about 20 to 30 foot (6.1 to 9.1 m) pounds. 8 Remove the jack from under the oil pan. Raise the front of the vehicle enough to remove your jack stands or blocks and such, and lower your Concorde to the ground.

This decay causes more and more chaotic engine movement -- shake, wobble, clattering, vibrating, noise, bumping about -- must be fixed. Here\u0027s your ticket to save several hundreds of dollars. Ad Steps Part 1 Removing the Engine Mounts 1 Choose a level, concrete surface (strong 3/4 inch plywood can make softer surfaces or the ground workable). Set the parking gear and the brake. Block the wheels. Raise the front of the LHS with a jack(s) and support the car with jack stands. Remove the splash guards under each fender to reveal access to the mounts. 2 Place a full width piece of 2 by 6, or 2x8 inch wood between a jack and the engine oil pan -- but not extending under the subframe. Raise the jack only until it just begins raising the engine a very little, to mainly support the engine, but not to raise the vehicle at all. 3 Loosen, but do not remove the upper nuts that connect the mount to the upper mounting-bracket using a ratchet and socket. (If your mounts have a heat shield between the mount and engine, remove the nut or bolt from the bracket holding the heatshield, using your ratchet and socket. Remove the heatshield.) Keeping the nuts loosely screwed on to just a few bolt threads, on the bolts, keeps the mounts aligned until both are loosened -- retained to this same degree, held on loosely, on each side of the engine. 4 Loosen the lower nuts: But, do not remove them from the bolt attaching them to subframe, through holes in the subframe, using your ratchet, an extension and a socket, for both mounts. 5 The transmission mount: Prepare to remove the third mount much in the same manner as the engine mounts (of a different design) at the rear of the transmission This mount may need to be replaced for backward and forward stability. Part 2 Installing Engine Mounts 1 Remove the mount nuts and replace only one mount at a time: Raising the engine far enough with the jack to get either one of the mounts off, then replace it as follows. 2 Slide the studs on the bottom of the new mount into the holes in the subframe -- and lower the jack a little to seat the engine mounting bracket down lightly onto the stud(s) on the top of the mount, maintaining alignment, so not binding, by tightening nuts and bolts little by little. 3 Install the lower nuts and \"finger tighten\" at the subframe, loosely as before, just by a few threads, to retain the engine positioning. 4 Install the upper nuts and \"finger tighten\", at the engine bracket, as well. Install the heat shield and its retaining bolts, if your vehicle is so equipped (on the 3.5-liter engine, for example). 5 Install the transmission mount by much the same techniques as the engine mounts. 6 Now, lower the engine a little. Snug the nuts and bolts on all both mounts, at first only \"finger tight\". Then snug them all a little. 7 Finally, torque all the mount attaching nuts and bolts to the manufacturers recommended number of foot-pounds with a torque wrench and a socket. The large nuts and bolts might be torqued to about 45 to 50 foot (13.7 to 15.2 m) pounds. The smaller bolts on the transmission mount are torqued less, perhaps to about 20 to 30 foot (6.1 to 9.1 m) pounds. 8 Remove the jack from under the oil pan. Raise the front of the vehicle enough to remove your jack stands or blocks and such, and lower your LHS to the ground.

This vehicle repair will take four to six hours depending on your skill level. Asking a friend to help will speed up the process. Ad Steps 1 Have a mechanic or auto part store verify that the alternator is bad before deciding to change it. 2 Purchase the correct alternator for your vehicle, remove wrapping and any other attached packaging, store in box until ready. 3 Park vehicle on a flat surface and wait till engine cools. 4 Pop open hood. 5 Using wrench and vice grips remove batter terminals, first (-)ground and then (+) positive. 6 Remove battery, battery rod holders. 7 Using a wrench, pull the automatic tensioner pulley to the loose side (towards the driver side) and remove serpentine belt. 8 Dislodge the intake coolant hose from the engine intake and restrain with zip ties to the hood rod. Some spillage of coolant will occur. Make sure to hold up right to reduce spillage. 9 Using a 10mm extended socket wrench remove the nut \u0026 connection over the (+)positive connector to the alternator. There may be a red rubber cap, slide off before removing nut. 10 Using the socket wrench remove the three bolts from the alternator cover plate. The alternator cover plate is a curved plate underneath the alternator that shields it from debris and connects it to the engine. 11 Using the socket wrench remove the final alternator fixing bolt. This bolt allows the alternator to swivel in place for ease in attaching the alternator cover plate. 12 Carefully wiggle the old alternator and alternator cover plate out of place and adjust so the back connection wire is visible. Set alternator cover plate aside for later. 13 Using your fingers, you may or may not be able to pinch the wire clip and disconnect it from the alternator. If not, use the vice grips to pinch down on the clip to dislodge it from the female connector in the alternator. 14 Bring up old alternator carefully between the engine and fan blades. Store in box to be returned to auto parts store for core refund ($) 15 Before installing the new alternator, remove the nut on the positive terminal, store in pocket for later. 16 Lower the new alternator into engine and connect the male wiring clip into female back end of alternator 17 This likely is the most difficult step; mount the new alternator into alternator mount. If the alternator mount is a tight fit, you may need to use the wood and hammer to gently tap the alternator into place. The mounting holes must be nearly perfect in alignment for the housing bolt to pass through and thread at the end. 18 Once the housing bolt is in place you should be able to swivel the alternator back and forth. Reinstall alternator cover plate first attaching it to the alternator then swiveling it in place to insert the last two bolts. 19 Tighten all bolts that hold the alternator in place 20 Connect (+)positive terminal to alternator and cap with nut and rubber sleeve. 21 Reconnect coolant hose to engine. 22 Re-install serpentine belt. 23 Reconnect battery, rod holders, and battery terminals (+)positive first then (-)negative. 24 After starting the engine return to an auto part store to have them run an alternator test to verify everything is in good order.

Ask it here: Submit Video General informational video for replacing an alternator in a vehicle. Tips When installing the new alternator it may be easier to access it from the bottom. You may need a friend when removing the serpentine belt and aligning the new alternator Setting the new alternator in place is very difficult due to such a tight fit within its housing. Try to fit the bolt through the front hole before adjusting for the rear hole to be aligned. Turning the belt tensioner pulley to the loose side requires strength and leverage. You may want to interlock two wrenches together to gain torque. The reason for the tightness when installing the new alternator is that there is a bushing at the front hole (elliptical in shape) of the housing. If you have some kind of tool for depressing bushings this will greatly ease the process. Warnings Some coolant may be dispensed when removing the coolant hose, make sure radiator and engine are cool before removing. Let the engine cool before commencing any work!

Saab recommends replacing the cabin filter every 12,000 miles (20,000 km). Learn how to replace the cabin air filter in a Saab by following the steps below. Ad Steps 1 Find the filtering unit. The unit will be underneath the glove box, attached to the side wall. It sticks out from the side wall and has two plastic locking tabs--one on the front and one on the side. 2 Push the center of the locking tabs in about 1/8 inch (0.3 cm) using a small screwdriver. Do not push too hard or too far. This may break or damage the tabs. The cover to the filter system will come away easily once all of the locking tabs have been removed. Set it aside along with the tabs. 3 Locate the 4 Torx screws underneath the dash and below the glove box. Torx screws are screws that have six slotted indents on the head. It takes a Torx screwdriver to remove them, similar to how a Phillips head needs a Phillips head screwdriver 4 Remove all 4 Torx screws and set them aside. 5 Pull off the lower knee panel. This panel moves down, rather than back. 6 Unclip the glove box light wires from their mounting clips. Move them out of the way. 7 Unscrew the 6 glove box mounting screws. 8 Unplug the glove box light wires and A/C duct and move the glove box out of the way. 9 Remove the black second filter cover using a small screwdriver. 10 Find the filter within the unit and slide it out. The Saab cabin filter slips into the filtering unit like a book being slid into place on a shelf. It will be near the back of the unit. It slides out and toward the center of the car. 11 Inspect the filter to make sure there is nothing amiss, such as fluid on the filter. This could mean a problem with the filter system or air conditioning system. 12 Slide a new filter into the slot. 13 Reattach the black filter cover. 14 Reconnect wires to the light and put them back into the mounting clips. 15 Reattach the knee panel, Torx screws and outside cover to the filter housing. To replace the locking tabs, pull out the center section of the tab slightly. Put it into the hole and press the center down until it is flush with the rest of the tab.

No matter which way you go, you\u0027ll have to order it and wait for it as they generally do not keep them in stock. You can expect to spend $50 ~ $70 for this item. Do not touch or disturb the new clock spring until later in the installation process. 2 You will also need: Phillips-head screwdriver Torx drivers #15,20,25 5/8 and /or 15mm open/closed end wrench 10mm socket 5/8 and /or 15mm socket Ratchet and 6\" extension to fit your sockets Torque wrench 3 Once the part arrives, you need to go to your local auto parts store and borrow a steering wheel puller. Advance Auto Parts lends those tools in Atlanta. Check in your area with the various Auto parts store. If they have one be sure to ask them to reserve it for you so you don\u0027t drive just to find it gone. Expect to leave a deposit for it with your credit card or cash. It should be around $20 which you\u0027ll get back when you return the tool. Then, park your truck in a safe place where you can work and if you don\u0027t finish you will not block anyone (including yourself) Do not touch or disturb the new clock spring at this time 4 Open the hood and remove the terminals from the battery. Start with the negative post (black, on left) 5 This is a view of the steering wheel from below in the drivers side. Note the 2 holes in the back of the steering wheel where the nuts are that hold the airbag. Also note the tilt lever right below the turn signal, windshield wiper stalk. 6 Remove the tilt lever by turning it counterclockwise. There is a little wrench flat area just under the knob. If you find a wrench that fits it, use that to help turn it, otherwise use pliers or a small adjustable wrench. 7 Next remove the bottom cover which is held by 3 Phillips-head screws in the bottom and maybe a 4th screw in the right lower corner (as seen from the driver\u0027s seat). you\u0027ll need a Phillips-head screwdriver 8 Using a 10 mm socket and ratchet, remove the 4 nuts that hold the airbag in place 9 Pull the airbag gently and lay it down to expose the wires you need to disconnect. The black wire is the cruise control (upper left) The yellow wire is the airbag (lower center) 10 After disconnecting the wires, loosen the center bolt which holds the steering wheel and back it out until there are only 2 or 3 threads engaged. Use 2 of the bolts supplied with the wheel puller that will fit the 2 diagonal threaded holes to the upper right and lower left of the center bolt to attach the puller block. Push the center bolt provided with the puller against the center bolt, but use a wrench to hold the center bolt so it does not turn. After a few turns of the puller center bolt, the steering wheel with pop loose from the spline Mark the position of the spline and the steering wheel so you will install it in the same place. Remove the center bolt that holds the steering wheel.. 11 Remove the steering wheel and remember how the wires were routed through the steering wheel. Now you see the clock spring exposed. Look at the wire that connects to the ignition switch and pay particular attention at it\u0027s location. Pull away the wire clip from the ignition switch. With a torx driver remove the 3 screws that hold the clock spring to the steering wheel column. Save these screws, you\u0027ll need them later Follow the yellow and black wires to the connections to the harness under the dashboard. You can pull the connectors out of the metal bracket to make it easier to disconnect the plugs. You\u0027ll get new connectors that will snap back into the holes in the sheet metal bracket. Notice the routing of these wires so you can route the new wires in the same way. 12 Take the new clock spring and locate it on the steering wheel column and attach it loosely with the torx head screws. Do not remove the 3 pronged white center piece yet!! Route the wires back to the connections under the dashboard Re-connect them as they were and fix them in the sheet metal bracket, be sure to route them as they were before. Replace the clip and connector onto the ignition switch. This could be a bit of a problem. You might want to try reinstalling the old one back in to give you an idea of how it goes in, before forcing or breaking the new one. Tighten the torx head screws that hold the clock spring in place Remove the 3 pronged white plastic center part but take care not to rotate, move or spin it in any way. replace the steering wheel on the spline routing the wires from the clock spring the same way they were before. Replace the center bolt that holds the steering wheel and tighten it until it\u0027s seated. Torque the bolt to the correct tension using the torque wrench. Do a search for the correct torque value for the size of the screw (the size of the body, not the head). Connect the cruise control wires to the steering wheel. Bring the airbag and position it in the correct relative position to the steering wheel so you can re-connect the yellow wire to the airbag. Replace the airbag onto the steering wheel and fasten it using the same 10mm nuts that you removed from it. Replace the bottom plastic cover under the steering wheel using the Phillip-head screws you removed earlier. Replace the tilt lever by turning it clockwise into its bracket. You might need a wrench or pliers to tighten it. 13 Re connect the battery terminals under the hood and test the horn button and see that the airbag light is no longer blinking. You are done.

Be sure to park the truck in a manner that won\u0027t block anyone while you are working and that you are safe while you work (remember that it might take you longer than you think to finish the job) Remember to disconnect the battery terminals before you start working with the airbag.

With air tools this repair can be completed within approximately 30 minutes per wheel - with hand tools the time varies between 30 minutes to several hours per wheel depending on how well / quickly the penetrating oil works and how badly the bolts are rusted / corroded. Ad Steps 1 Apply parking brake firmly. Place chocks or wood blocks behind rear wheels. Loosen the wheel lug nuts. Slowly raise the front of the vehicle by the axle and support it securely on jack stands. Remove the lug nuts and wheels and set them aside. 2 Using the ratchet, ratchet extension(s) and 15mm socket, remove the front skid plate and set it aside. Spray the bolts with the penetrating oil and allow them to \"soak\" if they are difficult to remove. 3 You may need to lower or raise the axle some to take pressure off of the lower link bolt, so that you can remove it easily at the appropriate step. 4 Using the ratchet and 17mm socket, loosen, but do not remove, the upper link nut. Scrub with wire brush and spray with the oil if needed as mentioned above. The picture at right is of the old driver\u0027s side link in my Laredo prior to it\u0027s removal. As you can see, it was horribly rusted and the bolts hadn\u0027t moved for 16 years - I had to use a great deal of penetrating oil and my cheater pipe to get them to break loose. 5 Using the ratchet and 18mm socket, remove the lower through-bolt nut connecting the link to the axle. Use the breaker bar and torx bit to hold the bolt in place as you remove the nut. Scrub and spray with oil as needed. Use the hammer to tap the bolt free of the link and axle bracket. If the nut and bolt are in good shape (not stripped out, cracked, overly corroded, or showing other signs of metal fatigue) set aside for re-use during new link installation. If not, replace them with hardware of the same size and tensile strength as the original parts (additional tools may be required if an exact replacement cannot be found - ie larger or \"box-end\" type wrenches, different size and type sockets, etc...). I re-used the bolts on my Jeep because they were in pretty good shape after cleaning them up. 6 Old Link \u0026 New Link Side by Side (through-bolt nut NOT in picture) Remove the upper link nut and remove the link and old bushings from the stabilizer/sway bar. This picture shows the old and new links prior to re-installation. The new link is about an inch shorter than the original and since I don\u0027t take my Jeep off-road, the shorter link provides a slightly stiffer ride. If you want to stay true to factory spec on your Jeep take careful measurements of the link shaft length and take them to your parts dealer when ordering your new links. 7 Upper Link Assembly To install the new links is pretty much a reversal of the removal process, but I suggest that you loosely secure the bolts and nuts at first to give them and the bushings a chance to \"seat\" properly before tightening to the final torque specs. When installing the bushings on the upper shaft of the link you will notice that they either have a small circular lip around the shaft opening or are slightly conical in shape on one face of the bushing. That lip or conical shaping needs to be against the sway bar (lip-side UP on the lower bushing, and lip-side DOWN for the upper bushing). Don\u0027t forget your concave washer-retainers. The order of installation is as follows: Lower retainer washer (cupped side up) Lower bushing (lip side UP) Through the sway bar (not shown) Upper bushing (lip side DOWN) Upper retainer washer (cupped side down) Upper nut 8 Once all the nuts, bolts, and bushings are properly installed and seated, begin the final tightening sequence using the torque wrench. Bear in mind that the bushings will be under extreme pressure after the nuts are tightened to their correct specifications and the bushings WILL NOT retain their original size. Secure the upper link nuts to 27 foot (8.2 m) pounds (324 inch pounds) Secure the lower axle through-bolt nut to 70 foot (21.3 m) pounds (840 inch pounds) in 10–20 foot (3.0–6.1 m) pound increments - alternating between sides at each stage. 9 Replace the wheels and lightly tighten the lug nuts. 10 Re-install the front skid plate and tighten the bolts to approximately 40 foot (12.2 m) pounds. Exact torque spec is unknown as of the original publication of this article. 11 Raise the vehicle slightly in order to remove the jack stands. 12 Carefully lower the vehicle and tighten the lug nuts to 100 foot (30.5 m) pounds. 13 After completing ANY repair on the vehicle suspension (and this is no exception), take the vehicle to a repair shop and have the alignment checked and/or adjusted by a properly trained professional. 14 Sit back and take pride in all of your hard work!

Video Tips This repair can also be done in a \"wheels on the ground\" state if you don\u0027t have, have access to or can\u0027t afford to purchase a set of jack stands. Set the parking brake and block the rear wheels as outlined above and slightly lift the vehicle with the jack from the frame rail just behind the wheel you are working on to provide sufficient clearance to get to the top nut of the link (you\u0027ll have to reach over the top of the wheel). Complete the entire removal and re-installation sequence BEFORE lowering the vehicle and working on the other side. If raising the axle is required in order to complete the upper nut removal and/or installation for a \"wheels on the ground\" repair, the factory supplied emergency tire changing jack can be used to do so. Exercise caution and remove carefully when no longer needed. It is always best to replace the links in pairs during one repair session, but if time and/or available resources don\u0027t permit, the links can be replaced one at a time. It may be necessary to lift the axle slightly in a \"wheels off\" repair with the floor jack to raise the link shaft into position through the sway bar in order to secure the upper nut. Exercise caution and lower the jack VERY slowly after the upper nut is initially seated/tightened. The \"cheater pipe\" mentioned in Things You\u0027ll Need is a short length of steel or iron pipe that slips over the handle of your breaker bar and/or ratchet wrench to give you a longer handle and thus more leverage when loosening or tightening the bolts. Warnings When working underneath the vehicle ALWAYS set the parking brake firmly, raise the vehicle with the jack and support securely on jack stands. Also place chocks or large wooden blocks behind the appropriate wheel / wheels to help prevent roll-back. NEVER rely on the jack alone to support the vehicle while performing repairs. If you are performing the \"wheels on the ground\" repair as mentioned in the Tips section, be aware that if the Jeep isn\u0027t jacked up high enough, the upper nut may \"pop\" off the link shaft due to the stabilizer bar straightening out, ricochet around the wheel well and possibly shoot out towards you. Exercise extreme caution. To replace the nut during re-installation, be sure that the threaded end of the link is exposed approximately 1/4\" - 1/2\" above the upper bushing when reinserted and tighten the nut down 2-3 full revolutions or until you feel it \"grab\" firmly to the threads. DO NOT torque to spec until the lower bolt and bushings are properly seated and the lower axle bracket nut and washer are installed at least finger-tight. Things You\u0027ll Need The replacement links (usually 1 link to a box, complete with the rubber or polyurethane bushings, concave steel retainer washers, and new \"top\" nut). Lug wrench. Safety glasses, goggles, and/or face shield. Gloves (optional). Automotive jack - preferably a hydraulic floor jack type with at least a 14 inch (35.6 cm) lift span. Wheel chocks / wooden blocks to place behind rear wheels. Jack stands (2). WD-40, Liquid Wrench, or other penetrating oil to help break stubborn bolts loose. Steel wire brush (in addition to the penetrating oil) to scrub off built-up rust and other residues in, on, or around the bolts. Breaker bar and \"cheater pipe\" to provide extra leverage when loosening stubborn bolts. Hammer (16 ounces or heavier). Air compressor and air wrench (optional - but use them instead of the hand wrenches if you have them - it makes the job MUCH easier). 15mm, 17mm, and 18mm deep sockets; T55 Torx bit 3/8\" or 1/2\" drive ratcheting socket wrench and extensions - depending on the tools and bits you have or can borrow/buy. Ratcheting torque wrench capable of exerting 100 foot (30.5 m) pounds (or 1200 inch pounds) OR MORE of force.

But several years\u0027 versions have a tacky (or, rather, insufficiently “tacky”) Achilles\u0027 heel: the perforated faux-leather padded door trim panels next to the driver\u0027s and passenger\u0027s peel apart, and the fabric backing, dry-rotted, dirt-accumulating soft foam, and plastic underneath are difficult to stick back together neatly. The manufacturer and dealers seem not to want to provide an easy, fairly priced fix like a replacement sticker, and the aftermarket doesn\u0027t seem to make (or has even in related situations been obstructed from making[1]) a coordinated repair part. So let\u0027s fix those panels! This “root canal for the car door” procedure should work well on other delaminated thinly-padded vinyl, but it has only been tried on the Mustang. For other applications, or similar procedures including different varieties of glue, test an inconspicuous spot first for adhesion and lack of surface damage. Ad Steps 1 Work outdoors. Deteriorated foam bits are messy and slightly sticky, stray contact cement is messy and super-sticky, and contact-cement solvent is foul and unhealthy. Put on some ugly clothes and your safety glasses. Arrange to sit on an ugly stool behind the door completely open so that drips will wind up on the ground (which is preferably not uniform, soil-showing concrete), not in the car. Gather gear, including the plastic spoons and paper towels to dab up messes before they harden or spread in the general area. 2 Apply masking tape. Use masking tape to protect the area around and closely under the repair area. Apply short, overlapping, bent strips at curves, and tip the edges into indentations for optimal results. Also cover the armrest and any other areas that the side of the roller you\u0027ll use to press down the vinyl may brush against, in order to protect them from scratches. 3 Expose a patch to repair. “If it ain\u0027t broke, don\u0027t fix it”: try to leave the door alone until the pad is loose at an edge. Messing with the insert involves some risk, and waiting for it to almost completely dry rot apart makes it easy to finish separating with little force. Once this has happened, peel the surface vinyl layer off to a point where the foam is somewhat sturdy, which provides access to clean out all deteriorated foam, and to which the panel could eventually be peeled from the other direction to the then-permanently-glued area to patch from that end. Leaving some attached eases alignment of the remainder. Peeling from the top edge down to the armrest and widest extent of the insert is a good start. 4 Brush off deteriorated foam. Use the vegetable brush to gently scrape away dry-rotted foam and dirt from the back of the cloth-backed vinyl surface layer and from the fibrous backing still on the door. Use patience, not force, for stuck bits. Remove any accumulation at the edge of the peeled area. Create a basically-clean, smooth surface for the cover and door to bond securely and without lumps. 5 Glue and press. Contact cement works well. It\u0027s usually used by applying to each surface, allowing them to dry to tackiness, and bringing them together to bond on...contact. But the vinyl panel and fibrous backing are permeable to fumes so it will eventually dry even if applied wet between the two. This has the advantage of allowing alignment and stretching of the pliable vinyl to the complex curves of the backing. Take out a little cement at a time from the container to a plate and use a disposable small trim-size paintbrush to apply a brush-width\u0027s or so to the inside edge of the yet-to-be-glued area. (Generally, start near the arm rest.) Apply a generous, glossy but not gloppy coating. And work fast—not allowing the glue to over-dry first, leaving it able to penetrate, is more important than perfect uniformity. Press the glued area down at edges (the back of a clean spoon works well) and across smooth areas with a soft roller. Continue with one brush-width\u0027s of glue after another. Gently scrape and wipe up any messes and switch to a clean tool or wash hands as needed to not spread them. Check alignment of all edges from time to time as you go and promptly peel back the vinyl to reposition as necessary. Try to avoid stretching the vinyl or distending it in a particular direction but the ability to tip in edges requires only care, not perfection. 6 Remove the masking tape next to the glue. Once you\u0027ve finished applying the glue, firmly pressed down the vinyl, and verified it seems to hold, remove the masking tape directly in contact with the glued areas so that it is not itself joined permanently. Use a clean implement to push back down any vinyl that lifts with it. Leave some masking tape on the armrest or other areas that may need protecting from roller-axle scrapes. 7 Re-roll. Every half-hour or so at first, and then every several hours over the next couple days, run the soft roller over the vinyl to ensure firm adhesion, especially pressing down any “bubbles” suspiciously reminiscent of the original delamination. They\u0027re not airtight – just hanging loose, and with soft glue inside ready to re-bond. 8 Wait to drive the car. The door panel will be delicate at first and its fumes will be foul. Don\u0027t drive the car for a few hours, and for the first couple days leave a window open.

The restoration may involve finding and using reproductions of a specific car\u0027s mechanical parts. How much work is required to restore a car depends on its condition and type. A convertible with a retractable top, for example, may need the entire top replaced. Try these steps to restore a convertible. Ad Steps 1 Research your convertible. Find out how it was originally constructed to get a more accurate restoration. Find data on the car\u0027s parts and manufacturing, such as names of its paint colors. Consult car magazines, websites or talk to car experts. 2 Determine what you need to restore in the convertible. Restoration may be limited to the exterior or also involve recreating the interior and/or the internal mechanics and wiring. If your convertible is obviously rundown or in need of repair, you may want to disassemble the car to check for problems or safety issues that are hidden from sight. Collect and label car parts in clear plastic bags or containers if removing them yourself. 3 Get any replacement parts for your car. Try ordering reproduction parts online or visit local junkyards to find parts. Reproduction parts should be easily available for popular models, such as Corvettes, Camaros or Mustangs. 4 Support your convertible on jack stands or other stabilizers when removing structural pieces. Make sure the car is completely stable for a smooth installation of new parts. 5 Begin working on a convertible\u0027s structure from the floor up. You may need to remove rust from the car through sandblasting or weld pieces of it together. Replace parts of your car as needed. Reproduction parts may need additional changes, such as cutting or welding, to fit your car exactly. 6 Apply epoxy primer to each restored area of the car\u0027s structure as necessary. The primer will help prevent future rusting. 7 Paint the car to factory specifications. Multiple coats may be needed. 8 Replace your convertible\u0027s top if needed. Many convertible tops are built in 2 parts, the main top and the section with a back window, referred to as the \"curtain.\" Get a replacement top with a rear window made of glass instead of plastic if you can. Glass will last for your car\u0027s lifetime and takes less work to clean and maintain than plastic. An inexpensive plastic window, however, can turn brown, get scratched, or even crack over time. Cover your car with protective wrapping to avoid damaging its paint. Take out the back seat to allow for easier access to components during the replacement. Prepare new seals for securing your new top. Remove the well liner from the car. It should snap out and may then be pulled out. Store and label the parts you remove in an organized fashion to make them easier to put back. Remove any screws, staples or other pieces holding the top in place, such as tack strips. Pull off the top cover. Put in a new back bow to structure the car\u0027s top. Prop up a piece of wood to serve as a spacer for the bow\u0027s required height. Adjust balance link adjustment bolts to control the top\u0027s even movement as it comes in from the sides to the front. Install new stay pads if necessary. Line up the new main convertible top with the header edge. Pull it back tight. Add other interior parts, such as a cable, spring and new tack strip. Glue the side panels down. Tape the top\u0027s seams. Fit the rear window to the rest of the top. Unlatch the top of the convertible to make it easier to install the back window. Staple in the window glass from the center outward. Staple a side binding edge for the top. Use a reference line to guide you. Mark the front header as a folding reference. Pull your top\u0027s material top tight and staple it into place a little past the front header\u0027s folding line. Tighten the top\u0027s sides to smooth out wrinkles. Clamp a curved piece of iron to hold stretched flaps for quarter windows in place. Check your seals. Staple the top\u0027s material so it overlaps over its edges. Staple the wire on back to the back bow. Steam away remaining wrinkles if necessary. Snap the well liner back in to the car.

Read on to learn how to get the switch replaced for restoring the lights’ functionality. Ad Steps 1 Take a good look at the brake pedal using a flashlight to find the switch on which these lights are attached. In majority of the cars, the switch is in the shape of a pedal. Most common problem is the switch dysfunction which gets the lights stuck. 2 Try to have it moved on either side using your fingers. The switch will definitely move from its position with a pop and if it does not, you will have to get it replaced. 3 Have the negative cable disconnected from the battery. To have the switches disconnected from the wiring harness you intend to have replaced, you will need to press hard its tabs. Also, make sure that the washer and retaining clip is removed if your car is built prior to the year 1990. 4 In case of new vehicle have the brake switch counter rotated in clockwise direction and have it extricated from the mounting bracket. Until the switch is made free from the bracket keep sliding it towards you. You will not need to have it rotated in case of old cars. 5 Insert a new switch inside the mounting bracket with one of your hands while pushing the brake pedal with another. Slowly allow the brake pedal to resume its original position. Have the new switch on top of the ‘mounting stud’ in case of old vehicles, ensuring that the pedal is right next to the “U” shape. Have the switch slid both in upward and downward direction so that the push rod is trapped and moved towards the pedal arm. 6 Rotate the switch in clockwise direction till such time it is locked into its place. Have the wiring harness plugged to the switch. Also, if your car is old have the retaining clip and the washer reinstalled. Get the plug and the wiring harness reattached. 7 Make sure you have successfully completed your job through several brake applications.

But don’t worry, there is a way to solve your problem that won\u0027t cost you much and it\u0027s based on using a drill. Ad Steps Part 1 Preparation 1 Use the adhesive contained in the kit to protect the body of your car. Often, there is lots of adhesive, so use it liberally. To practice, open the hood of the car (as shown in the picture). 2 Attach the disc contained in the kit to your drill. Choose the 500 weight. Don’t forget to wear your mask. Part 2 Sanding the headlights 1 Sand the headlights. Protect your mouth with the mask, then turn on your drill to begin the sanding process. First, sand the entire surface of the headlights. If you do that, the headlight will turn totally white (as shown in the picture). Keep your mask on your mouth to avoid inhaling dust. 2 Turn off your drill. Take off the disc which is on your drill and attach another disc (white). This cleans the headlights. Sand the entire surface of the headlights. 3 Finish the sanding phase. Change the drill (take the grey foam disc and put it on your drill). Then, fill the sprayer (with water) and wet the surface of the disc. This is important because it will clean the headlight. Drill with this disc to finish cleaning. Part 3 Finishing the restoration 1 Finish the restoring process. Keeping the mask on your mouth, change the disc on your drill. Put the remaining disc, the orange one, on your drill. Before polishing, if you have sanding paste in your kit, put it on the disc. Before turning on your drill, put some paste on your headlight using your drill. 2 Polish your headlight. This step is finished when the headlight is completely transparent. If your disc is dry, put some more paste on your drill. 3 The job is completed. Turn off your drill and take off your mask. Remove the adhesive from around the headlight, clean your headlight with your rag and admire the result. Congratulations, you have succeeded in restoring a headlight with a drill.

Follow these steps to retrofit air conditioning in cars to new refrigerant, such as R-134a. Ad Steps Part 1 Prep Your System for the New Refrigerant 1 Make sure that all of the old refrigerant has been vacuumed out of your air conditioning system. It\u0027s best to have a mechanic do this both for maximum safety and to ensure safe refrigerant disposal. Your mechanic will know the required EPA procedures for removing and getting rid of old refrigerant. Have the mechanic remove any remaining mineral oil from the system. Make sure that the mechanic flushes the system with a solvent that\u0027s compatible with R-134a. The mineral oil that is put back into your system should match the old oil. If you had PAG oil, then the mechanic should use PAG oil again.[1] 2 Install an accumulator or receiver-drier that contains desiccant. The desiccant helps to remove moisture that may accumulate in your A/C system. If your A/C system uses an accumulator, you\u0027ll find it at the evaporator outlet. You\u0027ll find the receiver-drier in systems that use an expansion valve to control refrigerant flow. It\u0027s connected to the high-pressure liquid line, between the condenser and the expansion valve. Make sure that your desiccant is compatible with R-134a refrigerant.[2] 3 Replace the O-rings, which are usually found at every connection. Do this even if you don\u0027t think that you need to replace them so that you don\u0027t have to do it later if they don\u0027t seal. When you remove an old O-ring, tape it to a piece of paper. Write down exactly where that O-ring came from and keep the papers for a while. If you have a leak at a connection, grab the O-ring that you took replaced. Double-check to make sure that you replaced the old O-ring with a new O-ring that was the right size. Most A/C leaks are caused by O-rings that aren\u0027t properly installed.[3] 4 Double-check your hoses. The hoses that you used with the R-12 refrigerant should work as long as they aren\u0027t cracked or damaged. If they are damaged, replace them. 5 Install a high-pressure cutout switch if you don\u0027t have one or replace your old one. When your system pressure gets too high, the cutout switch will shut off the compressor to keep from damaging your A/C parts and to prevent the system from venting refrigerant.[4] 6 Check the orifice tube. You\u0027ll find this tube connected to the high-pressure side at or near the evaporator. In some cases, you may find it in the condenser outlet. Don\u0027t try to clean an orifice tube. You\u0027ll need to replace it instead. 7 Add the appropriate PAG oil if your mechanic did not. Make sure to use the viscosity recommended in your car\u0027s operating manual.[5] Part 2 Add the New Refrigerant 1 Connect the recharge valve and service hose to your refrigerant can. 2 Turn the valve on the service hose. Doing this will puncture the top of the can. 3 Twist the valve back out slowly to release a little bit of refrigerant into the hose. The refrigerant will push air out of the hose so that it doesn\u0027t get into your air conditioning system. 4 Close the valve to keep more refrigerant from escaping. Connect the other end of the service hose to the low service fitting on the air conditioner. 5 Hold your refrigerant can upright so that the A/C doesn\u0027t suck liquid into the system. You only want vapor to be pulled into your A/C. 6 Attach a high pressure gauge to the high service port. The gauge will help you to make sure that your recharge is accurate. 7 Start your car engine. Turn the air conditioner on its maximum setting. 8 Open the valve on your refrigerant and let the A/C extract vapor from the can. The extraction may take up to 10 minutes. The air blowing from your car vents should grow gradually colder. 9 Watch your high pressure gauge. When the gauge reads 225 to 250 PSI, close the valve on your refrigerant can. Always close the valve before disconnecting the can so that you don\u0027t spray refrigerant into the atmosphere. Generally, your A/C will take in about 12 ounces (355 ml) of refrigerant. If your system isn\u0027t fully charged after your refrigerant can is depleted, then you can add another can of refrigerant until your gauge reads in the right PSI range.[6] Part 3 Finish the Job 1 Store your refrigerant can with the service hose attached. Refrigerant doesn\u0027t go bad, so you can use what remains in the can another time. Just make sure to store it in a cool place so that the can doesn\u0027t overheat and explode. You can also look into selling refrigerant back to a reclaiming facility or to a certified technician. 2 Install R-134a fittings on the upper and lower service ports. Doing this will prevent cross-contamination of refrigerant, and it is required by federal law.

Ask it here: Submit Video Fill Your Car\u0027s Air Conditioner With Refrigerant Tips If your A/C stops producing cold air after a short period of time, then you may have a leak. You can use leak detection dye to find the leak. Then, either fix it with a product like Super Seal (if the A/C holds a vacuum for at least 2 weeks) or take it to a mechanic (if your A/C can\u0027t hold a vacuum for 2 weeks). You can purchase a retrofit kit at your local auto parts store if you\u0027re not comfortable purchasing the individual parts on your own. Follow the directions in the kit to retrofit your car air conditioner.[7] Warnings Be careful to keep your hands and your tools away from moving parts and hot parts of your engine. Wear gloves and protective eyewear while working with your air conditioning system. If refrigerant comes into contact with your bare skin, it could cause frostbite. Replacing the mineral oil in your A/C system on your own could void your auto warranty. Make sure you know what the consequences will be before you do the work without the help of a mechanic.

These can be found on car paint from low hanging tree branches, other cars or car doors, stray grocery carts in parking lots, small animals, or toys and sports equipment among other things. Getting rid of these annoying imperfections does not require a complete paint job or an expensive body detailing job. Remove fine scratches from your car\u0027s paint with a few techniques that can be done in the driveway or garage. Ad Steps 1 Clean the area that has a scratch or scrape. Wash the car panel with a light soap and warm water. Dry the area thoroughly with a clean white towel. 2 Apply car wax or polish. This is the least abrasive measure for taking care of fine scratches. Sometimes it is all that is needed to get rid of a scratch. 3 Apply acetone to the scrape. Auto detailing solution can be used, but acetone products, such as nail polish remover, work just as well. Moisten a clean, white cloth with acetone and wipe it lightly over the scratch. Continue applying the acetone until the scrape or scratch vanishes. 4 Rub in some car rubbing compound. If the scratch does not disappear after applying the acetone, get some car rubbing compound and a buffing pad. The car rubbing compound can be found at any auto parts or body detailing store. 5 Use sandpaper on stubborn scratches and scrapes. Saturate sandpaper with water and rub it carefully over the affected area. Wet sanding will remove the scratches and any other imperfections by using the heavier grit of the sandpaper against the lighter grit in the paint. Use an ultra fine sandpaper, preferably a 2,000 to 3,000 grit wet/dry sandpaper when sanding. Add two or three drops of liquid dish soap to the water before wetting the sandpaper to make the water a little more slippery. This will help to improve the sanding. 6 Wipe the area with a clean, dry, white cloth. Dust away any debris or dust from the buffing and the sanding. 7 Inspect the area for any remaining scratches, scrapes or imperfections. Apply car wax or polish again if you used more abrasive methods. Using products such as acetone, buffing compound, and sandpaper will remove protective wax and sealers, as well as scratches and scrapes. Use any brand of wax or polish that is usually used on the car and lightly cover the paint with it.

Knowing just a little information about how things work in the industry can help you save your fair share. Taking these points into consideration, you\u0027ll be better able to achieve your money-saving goals. Ad Steps Part 1 Learning about your car 1 Familiarize yourself with the car. For this, you must read the Owner’s Manual. Reading the \u0027Scheduled Maintenance Guide\u0027 can help you familiarize yourself with your car. It informs you about the time when your auto transmission car needs maintenance, according to the manufacturer. Go through the car manual thoroughly, to know about the best time and place to spend limited dollars on your car\u0027s maintenance. Knowing the scheduled dates will help you to negotiate and budget better, as you won\u0027t be at the whim of the mechanic telling you car parts are due for maintaining, changing or updating well before the time the manufacturer recommends. Part 2 Finding a reputable repair shop 1 Find a reputable automatic transmission repairs shop. Always take your car to a well-known auto transmission repair shop for maintenance. Ask your friends, family and co-workers about a shop or mechanic that they know and trust. Search for local auto repair shops that specialize in auto car, van or pick-up truck maintenance. Being local, you\u0027ll find they\u0027re more invested in keeping a good reputation among their local community and there will be many locals who can vouch for the quality. 2 Check the place out. Make a visit first, to see what your impression is. Make sure that the auto shop has a clean floor. Check that they use clean rags, clear away empty containers or other trash from the floor and generally looks well organized. This will indicate that the mechanics take pride in their work and maintain a well-run repairs shop. 3 Choose a certified shop with certified technicians and staff who have certification in car repair classifications such as brakes, steering and suspension, or engines. Staff ought to be certified with Automotive Service Excellence( ASE). In case the staff is not certified, they must have some specific training regarding auto repairs; don\u0027t be afraid to ask to see it. Part 3 Preventive maintenance 1 Try the auto shop for preventive maintenance. If you have a list of repairs you need doing on a particular day, ask the repairs shop which services are most important, so as to make your list less long and more affordable. Do your calculations and go for the services your car requires the most. You can also consult your experienced friend for the estimate. Before getting the service, find out a rough figure of what the usual car service charges in your area for the same service. Browse through an online search engine to find out quotes from various helpful websites. There are websites in some areas which can provide you with a list of fair price shops according to your zip code. Such websites can provide you with the information and estimates for common repairs on the car in your local area. The best way to test an auto transmission repairs shop is to go there when your car needs an oil change and oil filter. By doing this, you can also clarify any queries which have arisen after reading your car\u0027s maintenance manual. If you have a long list of maintenance services that your car requires, make sure that you get it done in alignment with your car\u0027s current mileage, so that the car is kept in the best condition possible according to the manufacturer\u0027s recommendations. Choose from lowest to highest prices as per your pocket; there is no need to loiter here and there to find the perfect auto transmission servicing. Part 4 Reducing costs 1 Save yourself from duplicate labor charges. To reach the innermost part causing a problem, sometimes the mechanic has to remove many other parts. You can save money by repairing this part before it causes further trouble. For instance, to repair a squealing drive belt, the mechanic may need to change the upper and lower radiator, hoses and water pump and thermostat, because all this has to be removed in order to reach the drive belt. If you have good negotiation skills, you can save money by negotiating on the labor charges and get the whole lot done at the same time, for less. 2 Don\u0027t ignore warning signs––try to fix things while they\u0027re still small problems. Your vehicle gives you many signals when it needs a repairs. For example, sometimes the light flashes because the fuel filler cap is not properly placed. You can check this yourself by removing the fuel filler cap. See whether the gasket or rubber is in the right place or not. Now, replace the cap firmly. Now when you restart the engine and flashing light has gone, it means that the problem was with the cap; once fixed, you are good to go and potentially bigger, costlier problems have been averted. When you start the engine, if the check-engine lights comes on, get it checked quickly. It might be normal but sometimes it means something quite serious, so there is a risk involved in driving a car without getting it checked. Engine damage is costly, so the more you delay, the costlier the end result may become. If the check-engine light flashes on and off, get your car towed to your trusted auto transmission repair shop or bear the (costlier) damage caused by it in future. Never ignore the flashing check-engine lights. 3 Adopt a do-it-yourself approach. Some jobs are easy and can be done alone. If you can learn how to change air filters or wiper blades, you can save those dollars you would give to the mechanic for performing this little service on your vehicle. Choose the correct wiper blades or air filters for your vehicle by consulting a local parts person. 4 Use Internet shopping for some parts Some websites sell you parts at extremely competitive prices. You can order many expensive parts at affordable prices by following some particular websites that offer various deals. You can also check if shipping of these items is free or do they imply any sales tax. Compare local prices with prices on Internet, and go for a reasonable purchase. There\u0027s no harm in trying out. Ask your repairs shop if they are happy to accept your own-purchased parts rather than using their suggested parts. Use their labor but your online shopping savvy, to save money. 5 Find a cheap ding repair shop. It is inevitable that over time your vehicle will end up with a few dings, dents and chips. An auto-repair shop will sand down all the dented or chipped components; alternatively, repairing and repainting the whole thing will cost you a great deal. Check for a reasonable dent repairing shop instead, one that fixes used cars, and you\u0027ll save money by getting cheap dent repairs.

You can also save money by using coupons for routine maintenance such as oil changes or tire rotation. Continue reading this article to learn about the many different ways you can save on automotive maintenance. Ad Steps Method 1 Performing Automotive Maintenance Yourself 1 Use resources to help you perform your own automotive maintenance. You can find automobile manuals in bookstores or on the Internet, watch free online videos and tutorials that teach you how to perform certain tasks, and also consult with retail stores that specialize in automotive repair. Visit free video-sharing websites such as YouTube to watch demonstrations on how to perform certain tasks on your automobile. For example, if you want to locate videos that show you to perform an oil change on a Mazda Miata, type keywords into the video website such as \"perform oil change on 2011 Mazda Miata.\" Visit a retail store that specializes in selling automobile supplies, parts, and maintenance tools. In most cases, the representatives that work in stores such as these can provide you with hints, tips, and pointers for performing specific tasks on your automobile. 2 Change your automobile\u0027s air filters. In most cases, automotive shops will charge you up to 30 percent more for a new air filter compared to the price you will pay for a new filter at a retail store; plus, air filters on automobiles are most often located in spots that are readily accessible. 3 Replace the bulbs for your tail lights and headlights. In most cases, mechanics will charge up to 30 dollars (22.94 euros) to replace tail lights or headlights for you; however, if you perform the work yourself, you may only have to pay up to 11 dollars (8.41 euros) for new bulbs. Refer to your automobile\u0027s manual to learn how to access and replace your tail lights and headlights. 4 Perform your own touch-ups on paint scratches. Many automotive dealers will charge you over 100 dollars (76.48 euros) to touch up both small and large paint scratches. Buy car paint from an automotive retail store or directly from your vehicle\u0027s manufacturer, then follow the instructions provided with the product to repair and cover the scratches. 5 Perform your own oil changes. Some automotive maintenance centers can charge you up to 50 dollars (38.24 euros) for an oil change; however, a quart of motor oil will usually cost you no more than 10 dollars (7.64 euros). Change your motor oil every 3,000 miles (4,828 km) and dispose of the used oil properly at an automotive service center or recycling center. Method 2 Discounts on Automotive Maintenance 1 Ask automotive maintenance shops about discounts they can offer you. In some cases, an auto maintenance shop will provide you with an immediate discount to earn your business the same day, or to match the prices being offered by competitors. Call a variety of automotive shops to generate a list of prices and the names of shops that are willing to negotiate maintenance costs. 2 Use automotive maintenance coupons. Many auto shops will advertise coupons in print that can be clipped from magazines or newspapers, or will place coupons on their websites that can be printed directly from the Internet. Visit coupon websites that provide you with daily deals, such as Groupon, to find coupons for oil changes or tire rotation services in your local area.

All four brakes have audible brake wear indicators. When the brake pads need replacing, you will hear a distinctive metallic \"screeching\" sound when you apply the brakes. Keeping the brakes on your car in proper working condition is very important for your safety and the safety of others. The following is a list of instructions on how to service the brake calipers and change the brake pads on an Acura RSX. Ad Steps 1 Remove the five wheel lug nuts, then remove the wheel. 2 Remove the two 8 x 1.0mm bolts from the caliper. Remove the caliper body, then securely hang the caliper body from somewhere on the car using a rubber strap or something similar, ensuring that there is no weight or stress on the rubber flex hose. 3 Remove and inspect the two brake pads. Measure the thickness of the friction material on the pad. The pads should be replaced if the thickness of the friction material is measured to be 3mm or less. 4 Remove the two 12 x 1.25mm caliper bracket bolts. Remove the caliper bracket from the car. 5 Remove the pad retainers, the caliper pins, and the rubber boots from the caliper bracket. 6 Clean the caliper pins thoroughly! Also ensure the caliper bracket is cleaned, as well as the pad retainers if they are being reused. 7 If the existing brake pads are being reused, clean the pad by lightly applying a very fine sandpaper to the friction surface. Also scrape out any brake material that has accumulated in the groove in the middle of the pad! 8 Lightly apply some anti-seize to both sides of the pad retainer (front \u0026 back). Also, lightly apply some anti-seize to the inside of the caliper bracket, to the areas where the pad retainers sit. Re-install the pad retainers onto the caliper bracket. 9 Re-install the caliper bracket onto the car with the two 12 x 1.25mm bolts. Tighten the bolts to 108 N.m or 80 ft-lbs. 10 Apply a healthy amount of brake grease/lubricant to each caliper pin and inside the rubber boots. Insert the two pins and boots into the caliper bracket, ensuring the boots are seated correctly in the bracket. 11 Lightly apply some anti-seize to the two tips of the brake pads, then install them into the pad retainers on the bracket. 12 Install the caliper body onto the caliper bracket, over the two brake pads, ensuring the caliper pins are positioned correctly. If new brake pads are being installed, the caliper piston will need to be compressed first to allow the new pads to fit into the caliper. Also ensure flex hose is positioned correctly with no loops or kinks. 13 Install the two 8 x 1.0mm bolts into the caliper. Tighten the bolts to 32 N.m or 24 ft-lbs. 14 Re-install the wheel and the five wheel lug nuts. Tighten the lug nuts to 108 N.m or 80 ft-lbs.

A posiloc differential has clutches to distribute the torque to both wheels which increases the traction by allowing the opposite wheel to pull if one is simply spinning. These can be damaged or worn, requiring a rebuild. Ad Steps Part 1 Diagnosing the differential 1 Check the differential to determine if it needs maintenance. You will want to decide if it is time to tear down the differential, and there are a few ways to decide if a tear down is needed. 2 Set the truck on a lift, or jack up both rear wheels so they can be rotated by hand. Make sure the vehicle is supported if you use a jack, use solid blocks or jack stands designed for this purpose. 3 Check the differential lubricant. Remove the filler plug, and use a clean screwdriver or other slender object to dip inside the differential to check the fluid level. If the fluid is very low, continue with other diagnostic steps before filling it, since a tear down will require draining and refilling the differential, and any gear oil you add will soon be discarded. 4 Go to one rear tire with the truck in gear or park, and rock it forward and backward, listening for noises that indicate loose metal parts or grinding. The tire should move freely a few inches before the opposite wheel begins to turn. If one of the clutch packs has failed, metal parts will cause a grinding noise when the wheel is turned. Bearings and shims can also produce noises if they are substantially worn or damaged. 5 Shake the wheel from side to side, then up and down to see if there is any loose motion. If there is, an axle bearing has failed, and the differential will need to be disassembled for a repair to be made. 6 Inspect the pinion flange and driveshaft coupling. Vibrations and noise while driving can be caused by a universal joint or pinion gear bearing failure. From underneath the truck, with the vehicle out of gear, rotate the driveshaft forward and backward while feeling for and listening for sounds or loose play in the universal joints. From near the tail end of the drive shaft, any noises produced by manually rotating the pinion assemble should be easy to locate. 7 Road test the truck. Lower the truck to the ground, and prepare for a road test. You will want to locate a wide, flat, smooth area to road test the vehicle: a large, empty parking lot would be ideal. Drive the truck slowly across the pavement, making sharp turns both to the left and the right while listening through an open window for grinding noises. Since the wheels turn at different speeds from each other on a tight radius, this extreme turning may produce sounds indicating a problem. 8 Proceed to the next set of steps if you have decided a condition will require maintenance of your differential. Otherwise, top off the gear oil with a mixture of 75w90 gear oil and friction modifier and continue driving the truck as you normally would, paying attention to any sounds coming from the rear end while driving. Part 2 Preparing to disassemble the rear end 1 Jack the truck up and support it with jack stands. You will need to get the back wheels as high as you can so you will have room to work underneath it. Make sure the emergency brakes are in good working order and, if possible, do this work on a concrete driveway or on a garage or shop floor. If you have to work on dirt or grass, it is a good idea to lay plastic sheeting down and then place two sheets of plywood beneath the truck so parts won\u0027t be lost while you work. 2 Get an oil drain pan or other container to catch differential lubricant when the differential is disassembled. You will also want lots of clean rags or paper towels on hand. 3 Borrow or buy a differential tube adjusting wrench so the preload adjusters can be reversed. If you cannot find one, you won\u0027t be able to remove the carrier and disassemble the differential. One can be made by welding a 1½ inch nut on the end of a 30 inch long piece of 1 inch steel tubing, and grinding the flats on a taper down to 1¼ inch. 4 Gather wrenches, including 12mm, 13,mm, 15mm, 17mm, and a 5/16 inch box end wrench, along with a pry bar, and a pair of locking pliers like Vice Grips. It helps to have a workbench with a solid wooden surface, a bench vise, and bearing pullers, as well. For removing bearing races from the axles and differential, you will also needs a heavy (3 or 4 pound) hammer and a length of 1½ inch steel pipe. 5 Locate and price out a full parts list. You can wait until the tear down is complete if you like, but since some parts will require special ordering, it is better, if practical, to locate them before beginning the actual rebuild. For a complete rebuild, you will need: Axle bearings and seals Clutches and clutch retaining clips Differential bearings and races Pinion bearings, crush sleeve, and seal 3 quarts 75w90 gear oil and 4 ounces of posiloc friction modifier Part 3 Disassembly 1 Remove the drive shaft from the pinion flange. There should be four bolts, requiring a 15mm socket or wrench, holding it in place. You will need to pry the drive shaft toward the front of the truck to allow it to drop down, then the rear end can be swung around out of your way. Make sure you keep track of the bolts you have removed. 2 Remove the pinion nut. You may have to lock the emergency brakes to prevent the pinion gear from spinning while you break it loose. To remove the nut, you will need a 1¼ inch socket and a breaker bar. 3 Pull the pinion flange off the pinion gear splines and set it on a clean surface, then remove the pinion oil seal and the outer pinion bearing. A screwdriver or small pry bar may be used to pry out the oil seal. 4 Remove the differential cover. The bolts fastening the cover in place are 13mm (½ inch), and two should have tags on them, identifying the gear box ratio and assembly information. When all of the bolts are removed, position a large oil drain pan underneath differential cover, then pry the cover off slowly and carefully. When the cover breaks free from the gasket adhesive the oil will dump into the catch pan. 5 Inspect the differential carrier. You may want to spray an engine degreaser or use mineral spirits to clean the differential carrier after the oil has been drained. You will now be able to see the spider gear set, wrist pin, ring gear, and the back of the pinion gear. If you look closely, you can also see the clutches, behind the axle end gears. Look into the oil remaining in the bottom of the differential for metal parts or residue, and on the magnet located in the lowest part of the bottom for accumulated parts/metal residue. 6 Rotate the carrier until you see the wrist pin lock bolt. It will have a 5/16 head and be located on the right side of one end of the pin. Remove the lock pin by turning it counterclockwise until it is free of its threads and then pulling it out. Only the shoulder of the pin is threaded, the rest slides through the wrist pin lock bolt. 7 Push the wrist pin out of its hole until it is beyond the ends of the axles. Make sure it is rotated so that there is enough room to slide it far enough to clear the axle bolts without it binding on the pinion gear or the differential housing. If the wrist pin is pushed too far out, the spider gears may drop out of the carriers. This isn\u0027t really desirable at this point, but if they do, simply collect them and their shims and place them in a safe, clean location. 8 Remove the lock clips (horseshoe shaped clips on the inside ends of the axles) by sliding the axles in, toward the center of the differential, and then rotating them. Make sure you have released your emergency brakes. You may want to remove the wheels and brake drums to make the axle assemblies lighter, although this isn\u0027t absolutely needed. 9 Pull the axles out of the axle tubes. They will be coated with gear oil, so set them down on a clean, level surface to be prepared for reinstallation later. You can inspect the axle bearings and seals once you have removed the axles, but this is optional, and not a part of the differential rebuild. Still, if you suspect wear and tear on these parts, now is the time to deal with them. 10 Reposition the wrist pin in the center of the carrier, and thread the locking pin back into the hole far enough to prevent the wrist pin from sliding out again. This will keep the axle end gears and spider assembly together when the carrier is dropped out of the differential housing. 11 Remove the locking clips from each of the carrier bearing support caps. These are located in the center of each cap, and will require a 12mm wrench. They do not have to be completely removed, but only loosened enough so that the internal preloading nuts can be rotated. Taking them all of the way off will, however, make cleaning these parts a bit easier. 12 Slide the preloading nut tool through each axle tube and engage the nut on the end of the axle tube adjacent to the differential housing. You will turn these counterclockwise until the bearings are free, about 3 to 4 turns each. If you are not going to take time to set up the rear end later, you need to count exactly how far you back these nuts off so they can be returned to the same position during reassembly. 13 Remove the carrier bearing cap bolts. These hold the bearings which in turn support the carrier, which weighs nearly 50 pounds, so you may want someone to help support the carrier when these bolts are removed. Place each carrier cap with its bolts in separate places on their respective sides so they will be reinstalled the same way they came out. These are cast iron clamps, with one side and one surface machined to fit, and should not be reversed. 14 Remove the carrier from the differential housing. Lay it on some clean rags and place it on a workbench or in a convenient place to do the bearing/clutch replacement later. Look at the ring and pinion gears for signs of significant damage now, to determine if their condition will allow favorable results in a rebuild. If there are severely damage teeth on either, or if the spider gears are damaged, it might be time to consider a complete replacement, rather than a rebuild. 15 Remove the pinion gear by tapping the threaded end with a soft faced hammer. The assembly should slide out without too much trouble, but if a heavier force is required, take care to use a wooden block or other protective method to prevent damage to the threaded end and splines. 16 Clean all of the parts you have removed thoroughly. You will want to be able to inspect the rollers in the bearings, the splines in the axle end gears, and the mating machined surfaces for obvious damage or signs of wear before continuing. Any serious damage to machined surfaces or gear teeth will require replacement parts not covered in detail in this article. 17 Remove the wrist pin as you did in Step 10, above. This will allow you to roll the spider gears out of the carrier, and to remove the axle-end gears. When removing the axle-end gears, keep the clutch plates and clips together. The flanged clutch plates fall in an alternating order between the grooved discs, and the clips keep everything in position. If there is no obvious damage to these parts, you may choose to reinstall them, but replacement kits are available from several different sources. 18 Remove the carrier bearings from the carrier. A bearing removal tool makes this easier: You simply slip half the tool over each side of the bearing, then install the bolts, and tighten them with their tapered edges forcing the bearing away from the mating surfaces. You can also tap the bearings off with a large cold chisel, rotating it and hitting it in different places to prevent it from binding as you go. Part 4 Remove the pinion bearing and races 1 Remove the crush sleeve from the pinion gear. It should slide off easily, but may require light tapping with a hammer and punch. Set the pinion gear on a flat, solid surface and tap or press the bearing off the assembly. 2 Drive the pinion bearing races out of the differential assembly. You can use a section of steel pipe that fits through the housing from behind the race, or a solid bar, but make sure your tool fits squarely against the edge of the bearing race, and not on part of the housing. Tapping with a hammer as you move around the race should bring it out of the housing without too much trouble. 3 Flush the differential housing to remove oil and metal particles from it. You can use engine degreaser, or mineral spirits to accomplish this, but be careful since these are flammable. Use a container to catch the washout and dispose of it properly. 4 Inspect the gears and bearings for wear and damaged surfaces. Since gears are forged, then machined, they may have manufacturing imperfections like nicks in non-contacting surfaces, but the smooth faces of the gears should not have cracks, chips, or discolored areas that show evidence of over heating or binding. 5 Decide on whether the critical surfaces of the pinion gear and shaft are suitable for reinstallation into the differential. If not, you can order a replacement (usually paired with a matching ring gear of the same drive ratio as the original). Part 5 Reassembling the pinion gear 1 Install the new races in the pinion housing of your differential. If you do not have access to an installation tool, you can use the old races as a driving tool when you tap the races into place, or use a very large socket that is slightly smaller than the outside of the race. Tap the race around its circumference by working on opposite sides and keeping it aligned with the machined surface of the housing. If the race becomes off-centered, it may bind or even break, so proceed carefully. 2 Install the bearing on the pinion gear shaft, tapping it using the old bearing\u0027s inner race or a section of smooth pipe the same outside diameter as the bearing\u0027s inner race. Again, use care, since hitting the roller bearing cage or the bearings themselves will damage the assembly. After each bearing is installed on its respective shaft, lubricate it lightly with 75w90 gear oil. 3 Install the pinion gear into the differential housing. You may find it helpful to have a helper hold the pinion in place inside the differential housing while you install the crush sleeve and outer bearing. Once the pinion is installed, place the crush sleeve on from the outside, then set the outer bearing into position. It should slide onto the shaft with little resistance. 4 Install the outer pinion shaft flange onto the pinion shaft, then the washer, and finally the nut. Tighten the nut enough to hold the pinion assembly in place. If you have access to a wrench that will hold the flange to prevent it from turning, you can tighten the assembly enough to compress the new crush sleeve (it requires between 380 and 410 foot-pounds of torque, so it is very difficult to set the crush sleeve with ordinary tools). If not, you may have to wait until the carrier assembly is installed to lock the pinion in place while tightening it. Do not install the oil seal on the pinion shaft until final assembly (later on). 5 Tighten the pinion nut tightly enough to crush the sleeve to specification. If you are using a torque wrench and torque multiplier, use the above mentioned torque specs, otherwise, tighten until there are two or three threads showing outside the pinion nut with the flange pulled all of the way into the front of the pinion gear housing. 6 Back the pinion nut off enough that the pinion shaft can be turned by hand. You will need to set the bearing preload, this should be between 12 and 20 inch-pounds of torque. This is the force required to rotate the pinion gear, and the tighter the bearings, (hence, the pinion nut), the higher the preload torque. Setting the preload too high will cause the bearings to overheat, and subsequently fail, whereas, too loose will cause whining when the vehicle is driven. 7 Use an inch-pound torque wrench to adjust the pinion bearing preload. 15 inch-pounds of torque is generally sought, but a torque in the 12 to 20 inch-pound range is acceptable. Part 6 Replacing the bearings and carrier assembly 1 Install the new bearings on your carrier assembly. You can press these into place if you have a hydraulic press and suitable dies, otherwise, you can simply tap them in, using the same technique as with the pinion bearing. Make sure the taper is set with the larger diameter toward the carrier housing. 2 Reinstall the old clutches (or new ones), keeping the C-clips in position as you slide the axle-end gears and clutches into position. Once they are in place, you will need to hold the carrier in a level position while installing the spider gears and shims. Using a sturdy table with a cloth to hold the assembly may help. 3 Install the spider gears. Make sure the shims (concave washers that fit between the smooth face of the spider gear and the housing) are in position as you rotate both gears in opposition to each other so they mesh with the axle end gears. When the spider gears rotate so they are aligned with the holes in the carrier, you can reinstall the wrist pin. 4 Install the wrist pin, making sure the retaining pin hole is on the side of the carrier with its corresponding hole, and turned to align with it. Set the retaining pin into the hole and thread it a short distance to hold the spider gears in place. 5 Paint gear-marking paint on the ring gear\u0027s mating surface if you are going to reset the gear position. Not setting up the gears may cause the ring and pinion interface to be out of tolerance, since new bearings and wear can change the dynamics of the ring and pinion gear\u0027s contact. Since you have a preload reference for the gear assemblies, you may decide to take a chance replacing the carrier in its original position.—That choice is up to you. 6 Install the carrier into the differential housing. You will want to get it into position facing the bearing sockets resting on the housing bottom before installing the outer races. Otherwise, they will fall off while it is being handled. Slide the races on the bearings, then shove the carrier into position. 7 Install the carrier bearing caps onto the carrier bearings, and install the bolts that fasten them into place. You won\u0027t need to fully tighten the bolts yet, if you are going to set up the ring and pinion gears using the gear marking paint mentioned earlier. 8 Using the internal axle tube wrench, turn these nuts back the same number of turns you backed them off earlier. If the bearings fit too tightly to allow the full number of turns on each side, decrease each side the same amount so that they are near the same center as before. This would be unusual, but is possible if the new bearings are slightly wider than the original equipment. 9 Check the carrier for side-to-side play. If you can pry the carrier from left to right and right to left, there isn\u0027t enough preload on the assembly, so you will need to tighten the preload adjusting nuts more, going the same amount from each side. A small amount of end play may be tolerated when the carrier is set. 10 Use a dial indicator to determine if the ring gear is turning in a true fashion if you want. This will let you know if the ring gear or carrier has been warped, and, after the true-ness of the ring gear is established, you can use the dial indicator to measure the gear runout or distance from side to side it can travel. 11 Turn the ring gear one full turn forward, then one full turn reverse, to mark the gear contact pattern in the gear marking paint you applied earlier, if you are going to do this. This will ensure the pinion gear is set in properly and that its teeth engage the ring gear correctly. You can use an online chart or a reference guide to compare the wear pattern to determine if your gears are contacting correctly. 12 Look behind the carrier to see if the pinion gear\u0027s teeth are set flush with the end of the ring gear teeth if you are not using gear marking paint to establish their position. If the teeth of the pinion gear are sticking out past the end of the ring gear teeth, the crush sleeve hasn\u0027t been tightened sufficiently. If the pinion gear teeth do not reach the toe end of the ring gear teeth, the sleeve has been crushed too far and will have to be replaced. 13 Retest the torque on the pinion shaft with the ring gear engaged with the pinion gear. The preload on the combined ring gear bearings and pinion gear bearings should be about 45 inch-pounds. If it is higher, you can back off the preload nuts on the carrier slightly, if it is lower, tighten these a bit. 14 Reinstall the axles when you are satisfied the ring and pinion gears are set up correctly and the bearing pre loads are adjusted to specification. If you haven\u0027t torqued the pinion nut to crush the sleeve, you will have to install the axles to lock the pinion gear shaft in place to do so, then fall back to earlier steps in order to preload the pinion bearings and set up the ring and pinion gear. 15 Remove the lock pin from the carrier wrist pin. Slide the wrist pin out far enough to allow the axles to be installed far enough for the axle retainer clips to fit the groove at the end of each axle. 16 Slide the axles back into the carrier, fitting the splines in the axle end gears, and pushing through so the clip grooves are beyond the inside edge of the end gears. If the clutch spines are not perfectly aligned, you may have to twist the axle back and forth as you apply a steady pressure to get everything engaged properly. Do not tap or bump the axle, as this can warp or damage the thin clutch discs. 17 Reinstall the wrist pin and the wrist pin retaining pin and tighten it snugly. Some people use thread locking compound on the retaining pin but if you tighten it sufficiently, it shouldn\u0027t be needed. 18 Tighten the bearing caps for the carrier bearings, then the preload nut retaining clips. Check the torque specifications in the service manual for specific torque pounds for each bolt. 19 Clean the differential cover when you are satisfied with the set up and preload on the carrier bearings, ring gear, and pinion gear and bearings. Use a silicone gasket adhesive, and reinstall the cover. Tighten the cover bolts uniformly and allow the adhesive to set. Part 7 Installing the pinion oil seal and final assembly 1 Remove the pinion flange and nut. Install the pinion shaft oil seal by tapping it into place. Put a little grease on the rubber sealing surface to protect it during installation of the pinion flange. 2 Install the pinion washer and nut. Use red thread locking compound on the pinion nut to make sure it doesn\u0027t back off during driving. Tighten it to specified torque (80-90 foot-pounds), then turn the pinion to make sure the assembly rotates at the previous preload setting. 3 Reinstall the drive shaft, using thread locking compound on the fastening bolt threads. Tighten them securely. 4 Fill the differential with 75w90 gear oil, adding the friction modifier between the first and second quart of gear oil. The capacity of the differential is about 2? quarts, total. 5 Remove the jack stands and lower the vehicle back to the ground. You can now test drive it to see if your set up is correct. Grinding, roaring, or other noises from the rear end of the vehicle indicate an incorrect gear set up or bearing preload. If you hear these, cut the test drive short and disassemble the differential to look for problems.

Ad Steps 1 Take your mirror off the door. How to Replace a Car\u0027s Side View Mirror covers that part of the process. 2 Separate the glass from the backing plate that is attached to the motor that tilts the glass. This is best done with automotive trim and panel tools. The thinner the better. 3 Slide in one of your tools between the glass and the plastic backing plate. Poke it in so it is standing vertical  and creating a gap between the glass and the plastic. Take another thin tool and start working around the edge gently applying pressure and getting the glass out from under the small lip of the plastic. Do not pry the glass upward as you will most likely break it. 4 Find the tape inside. Once you have made enough space for one of your tools to slide in horizontally you will be able to feel some double sided foam tape. Push your tool into it to cut it. There are only two small patches of tape. Continue around the glass until you can cut the other piece of foam tape. You should be able to slide the glass out now. 5 Locate the two wires connected to the heating element. The connectors just slide off. Now you can put the glass to the side. 6 Unscrew the screw in the center of the backing plate. There is a small screw underneath it and the the main pivot joint. Now you can pull up gently on the backing plate and separate it from the tilt mechanism. 7 Start taking the base off. Start by taking the foam gasket off. It will mostly likely be stuck on there pretty good. Use a hair dryer to heat it up a bit and carefully take it off. You will see a little channel where the main wire sits. 8 Remove the wires. The connector on the end of the main wire is too large to be fed through the hole in the base so each wire must be taken out of it. You can use a micro screw driver to press down on each pin and pull it out. Make sure to take a picture of how the wires were before doing this. 9 Undo the 3 screws holding the base on. Once these have been removed you can pull the wire through and separate the base fro the main motor housing. 10 To get the motors out, first remove this small plastic piece. It will just pop off. The white tilt motor has 4 screws that hold it down. Remove these screws and slide the whole motor assembly out. 11 Remove the black housing. The part that controls the folding function is contained in the black housing. Simply pry the clips up and start lifting it off. It may be sealed with some RTV so it may be stuck on there. The wires coming out of the top of the black housing also have some gasket maker plugging the hole. If the cap doesn\u0027t slide up just poke this stuff out. 12 Find the circuit board with the motor under it. It is the silver cylinder. To access the gears there will be two screws that need to be removed. Once those are out you can slide the motor assembly up and rotate it out of the way. 13 Clean up any bad lubrication. Try to clean this all out the best you can and use some synthetic grease. Don\u0027t pack a ton in there, just you a small amount. The basic operation of this is fairly simple. You can spin the vertical screw which turns the gear which is attached to a worm gear which rotates the base. Go ahead and manually try to spin everything. If it binds there is some dirt or something in there. The second cause for your mirrors not work is that the gears have bound up causing the vertical  screw to come off the motor. The vertical screw is key to fit onto the motor. 14 Try re-pinning your main wire and testing the system while you have it out of the car. Or you could probably hook it up to another power source. Put the vertical screw onto the motor and then lower it back down so it contacts the main gear. Just hold it in place and give it some power. The mounting plate should spin, unless your motor has somehow been damaged. The key thing is to make sure the vertical  screw is seated properly on the motor and is contacting the main gear. 15 When you are satisfied  that it all works, screw down the motor assembly and lower the top cap back on. Since it was sealed with some RTV like stuff from the factory beforehand, you can do the same now.

If your air conditioner died, you\u0027ll pretty much have to. Opening your windows may seem easy - turn a crank, pivot a latch or push a button - but there is a best way to do it for a strong, quiet breeze and minimal air resistance. Ad Steps 1 Don\u0027t just open all of the windows. When all of the windows are open, or the windows on both sides are open, the outside air rushes in more or less evenly from each side, pushes on the interior of the car and the air from the other side, and rushes out the same side leaving the interior not well cooled. This happens unstably, for loud, annoying, hair-tangling wind buffeting. Large interruptions in the car\u0027s sleek sides increase air resistance and decrease mileage. Highway driving with windows open is said to use more gas than the air conditioner. Dogs or children may escape. 2 Don\u0027t just open a window all of the way. With a place to go in, but nowhere to go out, or vice versa depending on whether it\u0027s a front or back window that\u0027s open, there will be a similar buffeting problem. 3 Instead, just open both of the windows on one side an inch or two. This will set the air inside the whole car spinning as some rushes past and mixes in fresh air along one side removing the old, eventually warmed air. The small opening won\u0027t let in much road noise or even much light rain. The vortex will be strongest on the side opposite the open windows. So, if the driver is too warm or trying to stay cool and alert, and the passenger wants to doze or keep hair styled, the windows on the \"passenger\" side should be open. 4 Experiment with more complicated vehicles. Try opening two back windows on a long van, or a few, separated pairs of windows along a side of a school-type bus.

Here is an ordered procedure to help eliminate going back to readjust a setting after other settings are changed. Make sure the driver is in the vehicle or the drivers’ weight is properly simulated and positioned for the following steps. Ad Steps 1 Weigh the vehicle. Set it to the proper racing weight including all fluids such as fuel, coolant and oil (this weight is usually the minimum weight requirement per the rule book). 2 Determine the tire stagger to be used. Install a set of tires that will give you this setting with the proper air pressure in the tires. (Don’t overinflate or under inflate a tire to obtain proper stagger.) Set the air pressure in the tires to the pressure they will achieve at racing temperature. 3 Set the ride height of the chassis. Pick a point between the wheels and as close to the wheels as possible. It is preferable to have the measuring point on a common surface such as a frame rail. If the ride height is not to specs, turn the weight jack bolts or shim the springs to achieve the specs. 4 Check the caster to make sure it is at the proper specification. Caster is the forward/aft (longitudinal) tilt of the steering spindle/McPherson strut. Remember a positive number means that the top of the spindle/McPherson strut leans to the rear of the vehicle. If the caster is not correct, then adjust it to the proper specification. 5 Check the camber to make sure it is at the proper specification. Camber is the left/right (lateral) tilt of the steering spindle/McPherson strut. A positive number means that the top of the spindle/McPherson strut leans toward the outside of the vehicle. If the camber is not correct, then adjust it to the proper specification. When adjusting the upper a-arm of an a-arm type suspension, make sure to keep the front and rear a-arm pivot points equal to avoid changing the caster. In other words if the a-arm uses shims to adjust it, make sure to use or remove the same thickness of shim in the front adjust bolt that is used or removed in the rear adjust bolt. When adjusting a McPherson strut, make sure the strut upper mount moves laterally only and does not move longitudinally. After adjusting the caster and camber settings, it is a good idea to recheck them to make sure they are at the proper specs. 6 Set the toe in/out of the front suspension. 7 Adjust the cross weight to achieve the proper percentage of weight on the right front and left rear wheels. The easiest way to do this without changing the ride height is to determine the percentage of cross weight that is in the vehicle now. Multiply the percentage by the total vehicle weight. This is the amount of weight on the right front and left rear wheels. Determine the percentage of cross weight desired and multiply it times the total vehicle weight. This is the amount of weight desired on the right front and left rear wheels. Subtract the cross weight desired from the current cross weight (this is the weight difference and could be a negative number), then divide by 8. This number is how much weight on each wheel needs to be changed. Subtract this number from the left front wheel weight and adjust the weight jack accordingly. Add this number to the left rear wheel weight then adjust the weight jack. Subtract this number from the right rear wheel weight and change the weight jack. Finally add this number to the right front wheel weight and adjust the weight jack. An example of how this works is here.

Not only will your car horn drain your battery if it is constantly running, but it will be annoying to yourself and your neighbors or fellow drivers. A horn that won\u0027t shut off is usually the result of a jammed mechanical component in the steering column, and can be remedied in several ways. Follow the steps below to learn how to shut off a jammed horn. Ad Steps 1 Push the horn several times. Pushing on your steering wheel a few times may dislodge whatever is stuck in the horn\u0027s assembly. You can also try twisting your steering wheel back and forth a few times. 2 Determine if your car has a dedicated fuse for the horn. Many newer cars will have the horn on its own fuse, while other models may run several electrical components on the same fuse as the horn. If the horn has its own fuse, you will be able to remove the fuse without affecting any other components. The owner\u0027s manual will show a diagram of the fuse setup, helping you to determine how the horn is wired. 3 Disconnect the fuse for the jammed horn. If the horn has its own fuse, you can simply disconnect the fuse. Begin by locating the fuse box in your car; it is usually located on the underside of the dash just beside the steering wheel. Remove the cover to expose the fuse box. Using the diagram in the owner\u0027s manual or the diagram on the back of the fuse box cover (if there is one), determine which fuse controls the horn. Use a pair of needle-nose pliers or the fuse pullers included with your car to remove it. If the horn shares a fuse, be aware that you will disconnect the shared electrical components too when removing the fuse. 4 Disconnect the horn\u0027s wiring. If you can\u0027t turn off the horn by pulling its fuse, you can try disconnecting the horn\u0027s wiring itself. Turn your car off and open the hood. Locate the horn, which usually looks like a loudspeaker or has a toroidal (donut-like) shape. There will be 2 wires attached to the rear of the horn. If they are accessible, you can use pliers to remove them, shutting off the horn. Make sure to wrap the ends of the wires with electrical tape to avoid the risk of short circuiting your car. 5 Disconnect the car\u0027s battery. If none of the above solutions work, you can disconnect the car\u0027s battery entirely. This will shut off the horn, but also keep your car from starting. Make sure to wear safety goggles and heavy rubber gloves before attempting to disconnect the battery. 6 Take your car to a mechanic to ascertain the root cause of the problem. Even if removing the fuse or twisting the steering wheel worked, you haven\u0027t addressed the root cause of the problem. Have a mechanic inspect your car to determine and repair the issue.

Over time they can start to smell or lose their luster. You can make the interior of your car more attractive by cleaning it regularly and doing a few deep cleaning treatments occasionally. It is important to treat spills, muddy footprints and pet odors as soon as possible, so that they don\u0027t permanently affect how your car feels and smells. Assess the damage to your old car\u0027s interior, and treat it accordingly. Learn how to spruce up the interior of your older car. Ad Steps Method 1 Cleaning your Car 1 Throw away any trash that is hidden within your car. Check under seats, in the pockets and glove compartment and in the cup holders. Set aside any extraneous things, such as car kits, CDs and manuals before you start to clean. 2 Inspect your car for sticky or hard to clean stains. Spray them with glass cleaner and let sit for at least 5 minutes. 3 Clean the interior console of your car. The process that you use will depend upon if you have leather or synthetic interiors. Buy car cleaning wipes for plastic molded interiors. These will make the job go faster than using a spray with soap and water. Wipe clean the dashboard, console, steering wheel, gear shift and molding throughout the interior of the car. Buy leather cleaner for leather interiors. Spray the leather cleaner onto a terry cloth or other lint free fabric. Rub the surfaces of the leather well, but not too hard. Most leather is dyed and rough cleaning can remove some dye. Clean especially dirty leather with leather cleaner and a toothbrush. Pour some leather cleaner on a soft bristled toothbrush. Brush in a circular motion and then wipe clean. Wrap a car cleaning wipe around a flat-nosed screwdriver. Clean around the buttons, dials and vents with this tool. 4 Wet cotton swabs in glass cleaner or leather cleaner and clean the detail spots, such as the seams and embossed leather. Take your time with this step. 5 Vacuum the interior of your car, starting with upholstered seats and moving to the pockets and the floor. Place the seats in a reclined position so that you can vacuum between the seams. You can use a shop vacuum or you can go to a car wash and pay for time with an industrial strength vacuum. 6 Remove the floor mats. Hang them and beat them with a racket to remove hidden dust and dirt. 7 Look for deep stains. Remove blood or bright stains with cold water. Try to treat the stain immediately to avoid discoloration. 8 Remove car sickness stains with a mixture of baking soda and water. Sponge the mixture on lightly. Allow it to sit for 20 minutes and then rub clean. Dry with a hair dryer if too much water soaks into the flooring or upholstery. 9 Clean general car upholstery stains with a carpet cleaner. You can also make a homemade cleaner by mixing 1 gallon (3.8 L) of hot water with 1/2 cup (118 ml) vinegar and 1 oz. (30 ml) of dish soap. Mix well. Apply with a hard bristled brush. Let it sit for 30 minutes and dry by blotting with towels. Use a hair dryer on any soaked areas of upholstery. 10 Apply the upholstery cleaning mixture to the removable floor mats. Since they are thick, you can use plenty of water. Clean thoroughly with a hard-bristled brush, rinse and hang to dry. 11 Spray the inside of the windows with glass cleaner. Wipe dry with a lint-free cloth. Method 2 Improving your Car Interior 1 Spray air conditioning treatment into the air vents at the top of your dashboard, below the windshield. Air conditioning treatment is available at stores that specialize in car parts. Let the treatment sit according to package directions. 2 Brighten synthetic carpets with a mixture of 1 pint of water and 1/2 cup (118 ml) of clear ammonia. Use a damp sponge to mop the mixture onto the carpet. Blot out excess moisture with dry towels. Do not use this mixture on wool carpeting. Check in your driver\u0027s manual to see if you have wool carpet. 3 Look for fraying carpeting. Buy liquid resin from a craft store. Paint the liquid resin onto the edges and the seams to stop the fraying and lay the worn edges down. 4 Sprinkle Borax on the carpets to remove bad odors. Leave the Borax on the carpeting for 1 hour and then vacuum it up. This is essential for a car that often carries around pets. 5 Rent a steam cleaner to deep clean the upholstery and floor carpet. Suck up all the excess water and open the car doors to make sure it dries completely before using the car. Use a hair dryer to get rid of excess moisture. 6 Wax your clean, dry floor mats with liquid shoe wax. This will make them easier to clean. 7 Look for indentations in the carpet caused by heavy objects. Remove the objects first, and then place a damp towel over the indentations. Heat an iron on a low setting, and place it over the towel. As the towel dries, it will lift up the indentation. Make sure not to hold the iron in 1 place for too long. 8 Spray your cleaned synthetic upholstery with Scotch Guard upholstery protector. Allow it to dry according to package directions. This will make your upholstery easier to clean in the future.

That\u0027s why it\u0027s important to be prepared for the winter season and the car trouble that might ensue. Read after the jump to learn what to do when your car won\u0027t start and what you can do to prevent this problem beforehand. Ad Steps Part 1 Starting the Engine 1 If you suspect the battery may be drained from sitting several days, shut the car\u0027s doors and turn off all accessories. This includes the heater blower, radio and lights. This will help to maximize your starting power. However, if you have driven the car more than 20 minutes since the last start and within the last day, you will get some benefit to exercising the battery a while before trying to start the car. 2 Turn the key to start and hold it for up to 10 seconds. Don\u0027t hold it for any longer than 10 seconds, as overworking the starter can cause it to overheat. If the engine fails to crank, wait a couple of minutes and try again. 3 Let the battery recover if the car fails to start. If your car does not start after ten to twenty seconds of cranking, stop and wait for a minute or two before attempting to start again. This gives the battery time to recover, and it will have warmed a bit. Mostly, it allows the starter motor to cool down. If the car is coming close to starting, but seems sluggish, give it a break and try again. If the battery won\u0027t make any effort to turn the engine over, it is discharged and you\u0027re going to need to jump it. If after trying many times the starter is still sluggish, you may need to heat up the battery. You can do this by removing it and bringing it inside, but be aware you may have a fault indication for a while after it is reinstalled. You will not harm the vehicle by removing the battery. From very cold weather, it may take up to 2 hours to warm the battery sufficiently to increase its available amperage. 4 Consult the owner\u0027s manual. Almost every vehicle today has cold-starting instructions in the Operator\u0027s Manual that instruct you to use a small amount of throttle to help with a cold start. Refer to your vehicle\u0027s Operator\u0027s Manual for further information. If you do not have the owner\u0027s manual for your car, you can order one from a car dealer, find one at a salvage yard or look for one at an auto parts chain. You can also find many owner\u0027s manuals online. Try typing in \"car owner manual\" into a reputable search engine and look for relevant results. 5 For cars older than about 1985, with engines with a carburetor, gently push on the gas pedal while still parked. Depress the accelerator once and then release it. This will dispense a small amount of fuel into the intake, which can help get things going. Note that there is no need to do this with fuel-injected engines. If your car is newer than about 1990, it has electronic fuel injection. Part 2 Jumping a Dead Battery 1 Jump-start the battery if it fails completely to start. If the starter won\u0027t turn over at all, your battery is probably dead. It\u0027s now time for a jump-start. You will need a set of jumper cables and a willing volunteer with a running car to complete the jump. 2 Position the running car as close to the car with the dead battery as possible. You\u0027ll want the front ends of the cars facing each other, if possible. 3 Hook up the jumper cables to the appropriate terminals. Look for the + and - symbols on the jumper cables and connect the one with the + symbol to the positive terminals on both the running car and the car with the dead battery. Attach the cable with the - symbol to the negative terminals. An easy way to remember how to hook up the jumper cables is to remember \"red-dead, red-alive.\" Hook up the red clamp to the red post on the dead battery, then the red clamp to the red post on the running car, and then do the opposite for the black clamps. The black post to the \"alive\" car and lastly the black clamp to the \"dead\" car. Please note that the black clamp on the \"dead\" car must be connected either an unpainted engine bolt or the mounting bracket of the alternator, not the battery terminal itself. This is to avoid a short circuit. 4 Allow the dead battery to charge from the running car for a few minutes. When you are about to start the car with the dead battery, it may be helpful to rev the running car a bit. 2000 RPM is plenty. 5 Try to start the car with the dead battery. If it doesn\u0027t work on the first try, double-check to make sure the jumper cables are connected properly (especially the negative/black cable if not connected to the battery) before letting the running car run for a while and trying again. 6 Disconnect the cables promptly, but continue to run the engine of the both cars for several minutes to ensure both batteries have charged enough for another start. Since modern cars have alternators, they are able to maintain charging voltage even at idle RPM. There is no need to rev the engine. 7 Replace the battery if necessary. At some point in every car\u0027s lifetime, its battery must be replaced. This is because car batteries have a limited service life, and no amount of maintenance or care can reverse the effects of chemicals on metal.[1] Car batteries typically last about four years. If you\u0027re changing your car battery yourself, ensure your vehicle is turned off and in park, with the emergency brake set. Always wear gloves and safety glasses when changing the battery of a car, as car batteries contain potentially hazardous acids and gases, which can be released if the battery is mishandled. You should also make sure that your car battery is recycled using the correct procedures, you can do this by bringing your used battery to a local recycling center, or to certain repair shops. Part 3 Preventing Problems 1 Warm the engine with a block heater. An engine block heater is a small heating device installed in the engine that plugs into a wall socket. It warms the engine and oil and eases start-up. Engine block heaters are not expensive, but they must be installed properly by a mechanic. 2 Keeping your car\u0027s battery warm. Your car\u0027s battery can deliver much more power when it\u0027s warm. You can do this using a battery wrap. A battery wrap or blanket is usually a fixed installation of insulation and heating element around the battery. They require about an hour to sufficiently warm the battery. 3 Park indoors. Parking indoors, in a garage, helps to shelter a car\u0027s engine from icy winds and freezing temperatures. Heat the garage, if possible, to keep the temperature warmer. 4 Use thinner oil. In the extreme cold, oil thickens and doesn\u0027t flow quickly to vital engine parts that need lubrication. A lightweight, winter-grade oil flows easier in cold weather and increases fuel economy.[2] Your owner\u0027s manual should tell you the ideal type of oil you should use. 5 Use gas line antifreeze with fuel stabilizer. Gas line antifreeze, also known as dry gas, is a chemical (essentially Methyl Hydrate) that is added to your gas tank to inhibit your gas line freezing. If your gas line freezes, your car will not be able to start until it thaws. Many gas stations already add an anti-freeze agent into their gas during colder weather months. Check with your station of choice and see if this is their practice. Add dry gas to your petrol or gas fill-up before filling the tank (if possible) to ensure it mixes completely in the tank. 6 For diesel engines, consider using fuel conditioner. A fuel conditioner is a multi-functional diesel fuel additive. A diesel engine will start better in the cold if you use fuel conditioner, which prevents the fuel from \"gelling\" and ensures reliable fuel performance in severe winter conditions. 7 Keep your fuel tank full. Condensation on the walls of a gas tank will form and will eventually sink to the bottom and cause freezing problems in your fuel lines. It\u0027s much more difficult to start a cold car with a mostly-empty tank, so do yourself a favor and gas up often in the winter before letting the car sit. Part 4 Winterizing Your Car 1 Replace your windshield wipers and wiper fluid. Wiper blades crack in the cold and become much less effective, which can be dangerous in inclement weather. Low visibility can make driving in cold weather extremely dangerous, so it\u0027s important to make sure the wiper blades are up in tip-top shape. Replace them every 6 months or so. 2 Check your tire pressure and consider snow tires. Extreme shifts in temperature affects the pressure of your tires, and driving on tires with inadequate pressure in them can be quite dangerous. Cold tires will read differently than tires that have been warmed, so you\u0027ll want to drive around a bit before checking the pressure at the gas station or at the tire shop. If you live in a place with heavy snowfall, consider putting snow tires on your car, or purchasing a set of chains to use in bad weather. Check your local laws on the use of chains however, as they are illegal in some regions due to the risk of damage to the road surface. 3 Maintain the battery. Winter is tough on batteries, for two main reasons. The battery cannot produce its normal amount of power because of the cold. The chemical reactions that generate electricity are slower at a lower temperatures.[3] Checking your car battery from time to time will help you stay on top of any maintenance issues, but be aware that most car batteries only last between three and five years. In addition, engines are harder to turn over because the oil inside them is thicker. This demands more amperage from a battery. Multi-viscosity oils, such as 10W30, though, alleviate most of this impact. Check the battery cables and clamps for fraying or corrosion. If there\u0027s a white, powdery substance around the clamps, that\u0027s corrosion from battery acid. You can clean it off easily with baking soda, water and a toothbrush. Your battery contains a liquid electrolyte, which can evaporate and spill so make sure it has enough inside. Most batteries have caps on top, and you can check the level by removing the caps. If it\u0027s low, fill the holes with distilled water, being careful not to fill past any fill level indicator or the bottom of the cap.

Ask it here: Submit Tips Get as much snow and ice off the car as possible. It helps to have the car running and slowly heating up while you do this, of course, but a load of ice-cold snow weighing down upon the car isn\u0027t doing you any favors. Sweep great quantities of snow off the car and bust up any ice built up in the wheel wells. Also make sure your wiper fluid ducts and windshield wipers are free of ice. To keep your battery warm, you can also unhook the terminals and bring the battery inside for the night. While this takes some effort, it may be easier than spending 30 minutes each morning trying to resurrect your battery from the dead. Before you head out, start the car for a few seconds depending on how cold it is. Engine oil is viscous when it\u0027s cold and does not lubricate properly until a few seconds after starting the engine. Warnings Never heat your battery by direct application of high heat. Never make a fire and park your car over the burning embers.

There are a number of steps that you can take to protect yourself and your family if you are planning a trip that would require you to travel through remote areas such as the desert. Ad Steps 1 Prepare for your trip adequately by stocking your car with emergency items. Keep your cell phone fully charged. You may not have reception in the area where you break down, but if you choose to leave your vehicle and travel closer to civilization, you may be able to pick up reception. Bring hard copies of your maps. Just because your cell phone is working now does not mean that your cell phone will work if you get stuck in the wilderness of a desert. MapQuest maps are great for to and from directions, but you might consider an atlas to have a better picture of the area 360 degrees around your breakdown site. Pack plenty of food and water. Bottled water and nonperishable food items make great snack items, but they can also generally keep until the next trip. Make sure that you have your spare tire with your vehicle in case of a flat. With that, ensure that all of your tire-changing tools are packed in the vehicle as well. Keep blankets in the back of your vehicle. They don\u0027t take up much room, and you will be grateful to have them when the temperature drops. Keep a small emergency kit with matches and/or a lighter, flares, a flashlight, first aid supplies and other miscellaneous items in your vehicle. Additional items to consider keeping in your vehicle are tire repair goo and a small tire pump. You may not be strong enough to change your tire, but you can probably patch and refill the air every couple of miles to get you to a safe location. You might also think about packing a signal mirror, a weapon and comfortable hiking shoes, just in case. 2 Consider using a reliable GPS system, or use your phone to access GPS. 3 Familiarize yourself with your route, and pay attention to the mile markers. This will help you in the event that a decision has to be made regarding leaving the vehicle to seek help or staying with it to flag someone down to assist. 4 Have someone show you basic car mechanics before you go on your trip. Get trained in how to change a tire, how to cool an engine, etc. 5 Pull your car over as far as you can so as not to impede traffic or cause someone else to be in danger. 6 Stay with your vehicle in the event of a breakdown unless you are on a clearly uninhabited road. Your best survival is to stick with the vehicle, try to repair it and/or flag down another driver. 7 Take advantage of any shade that your vehicle gives you and ration your water. 8 Use flares to flag down passing motorists. 9 Consider putting a \"HELP\" sign in your car windows. 10 Always let friends, family or loved ones know that you are taking a trip into or through the desert. Let them know your departure time and estimated time of arrival so that they can seek emergency help if you are gone considerably longer than expected. 11 Rent a satellite phone if you plan to take your vehicle off-road for any reason during your time in the desert.

Here\u0027s what you need to do. This can be a tricky project for people without any mechanical knowledge, or patience. If you have any concerns about doing this, you may want to have a professional or mechanically inclined friend do it for you. Ad Steps 1 Unscrew the gauge cluster housing; the top 2 screws are behind pop off panels on the top of the housing. A stubby flat head screwdriver works best here to pop off the screw covers. Then, a stubby phillips works best to get the 2 screws out. There are another two screws on the bottom that you\u0027ll need to remove before taking off the cover. 2 Make sure you remove the 2-3 wire harnesses in back for the hazard switch, defroster, and any other harnesses back there. There may be more or less than 3 depending on the options the car has. The harnesses are very easy to remove. You simply squeeze with your thumb the ribbed portion, and pull. The separate very easily, if it\u0027s giving you trouble you\u0027re not squeezing hard enough, or in the right location. The hardest part here is having enough room for your hands to fit behind the cover. 3 Remove 4 more screws (2 on each side), then reach behind and unplug 3 plugs and unplug the speedometer cable (it unclips just like the plugs do) Then you\u0027re ready to pull the cluster out. The 3 harnesses pull out just like the other ones. The speedometer cable pulls straight out after you use your thumb to depress the little tab. 4 The clear plastic cover and black surround pop off as one piece. The trip odometer reset button has a rubber tip that needs to be pulled off first. 5 Pull the screws behind the speedo (2 of them have the wires from the grey box on them ) Then the speedo comes out. 6 Carefully, pry the speedo needle off, it pulls straight off, but it\u0027s really tight and really fragile. Then remove the 2 screws on the face and the face comes off. You have to do this because it\u0027s illegal to turn back the odometer, and besides, it\u0027s just plain easier to swap the original odometer for the new one. 7 The trip odometer reset buttons are in a slightly different place on the 2 speedos, so you have to swap the buttons as well. One screw will get the button itself off, and a tiny little clip holds the rod in place. Make sure you\u0027re in a clean work area here, because those little clips like to go flying! Also, notice that the blue plastic piece has a spring on it, more potential for parts flying! Pay close attention to how that spring goes on before removing, It\u0027s a little tricky to get on right. 8 Going back together is as easy as reversing the process. Now the new cluster has the old odometer in it. Be careful that the speedo needle is pointing to zero at rest; it\u0027s capable of going on in almost any position. If you\u0027re going to install colored face gauges or face inserts/covers, now is the time. Same goes for an aluminum bezel. These can be bought on eBay for $10 + shipping, and give the cluster a race look. If you don\u0027t like the aluminum look, feel free to paint, powdercoat, or dye it! 9 On top of the cluster is this little piece that holds 2 light bulbs, it casts an amber glow on to the gauges. You can replace the colors in these bulbs. 10 Put everything back together reverse of taking it off. The wiring harnesses and speedos go back on til they click. 3 plugs, 1 speedo cable, and 4 screws. 11 Enjoy your new tachometer. Put the stock one back together too and sell it on eBay!

If it is in correct and still doesn\u0027t work, you might want to take the whole cluster out again and take off the plastic face and get right to the needles. Rotate the needles around by hand to loosen them up if they have gotten sticky from not being used in a long time. Be careful as the needles are delicate, and also make sure they fall back into the 0 mph (or 0 km/h) place or else you will not have an accurate reading.

How do you take care of it to make sure it is safe, legal, and will keep running when you need it. Ad Steps 1 Ensure you and the car are insured with at least liability insurance so if you crash into another car, or something, or someone, that the repairs, and or medical bills will be covered by your insurance. Keep a copy of the current insurance summary in the car in a safe place so it is easy to find but won\u0027t get tossed out when you clean up, vacuum, and de-trash your car. Keep in mind that if you crash into the nice car that belongs to someone else it could cost over $50,000 to fix or replace the car. Make sure you have enough coverage. 2 Ensure you have a copy of the current vehicle registration papers in the car. 3 Ensure you have the current safety and emissions inspection documents. 4 You may want to keep the maintenance receipts in the car as well. Some people keep these in another location but this is a problem when you are at the shop, or home for the weekend. You may wish you had them in the car if someone asks when you last rotated the tires, changed the oil or transmission fluid, or flushed the radiator. Keep these receipts in the car. 5 Learn how to check the pressure in all of the tires and keep a tire pressure gauge in the car so you can check it at least monthly. Under inflated tires cause many accidents. An under inflated tire can be torn off the rim when cornering hard causing a serious crash. 6 Remember that the oil in the engine needs to be changed regularly. Check the owners manual for guidance. Many cars need it changed every 3,000 miles (4,800 km). 7 Air filters should also be replaced periodically. Dirty oil and dirty air filters will allow dirt into the engine and scar the inside of the engine making wear out much faster and cause early and very expensive engine failure. 8 Rotate your tires every time you change the oil. This means having the wheels taken off and put back on in different locations such as moving the front tires to the back and vice versa. This helps the tires wear more evenly and last sometimes twice as long. 9 Check the pressure in the spare tire every month along with all of the other tires. Seasonal temperature swings can change the pressure in tires even if there is no leak. 10 Your brakes should be visually inspected at least once every year. Brake shoes eventually wear out just like the soles of your walking shoes. When they wear all the way through it can cause damage to the brake rotor that can be expensive to fix. Even though they stop the car effectively the shoes could be very thin and start damaging the brakes any time so check them visually when rotating your tires. 11 Learn how to check the vital fluids in your own car for your own safety. These are easy to check on most cars by opening the engine compartment. 1. Oil, 2. Coolant/Anti-freeze 3. Transmission fluid, 4. Brake Fluid, 5. Windshield wiper fluid. If they are low they should be topped off. If they keep getting low you might have a leak. Check your parking spot for drips. 12 Learn to change a flat tire. Learn how to use the jack and lug wrench that is in your car and practice jacking up your car and changing a tire in your driveway so you will know what to do if you get a flat. 13 In case of emergency keep a few items in a duffel bag in your car. Think about what you might need or want if your car broke down or got smashed and you had to stand outside for 3 hours waiting for help. What if you had to walk home in the heat or in a storm. Suggested items include: 2 liters (0.5 US gal) of drinking water First Aid kit Working Flashlight Warm jacket Rain poncho 6 X 8 foot tarp 50 feet (15.2 m) of thin rope (parachute cord is ideal) $30 cash in ones and fives. If you live in a cold climate you may want to add an extra bag in the winter months that contains: An extra warm winter coat Warm winter gloves Extra pants or thermals Extra socks (wool) Winter boots These items could be used items from a garage sale or thrift store. 14 Learn how to wash your car. Never wipe off a dry car, it will scratch the paint. 15 If you live in a wet or snowy climate you may find it helpful to throw an old towel on the floor of your car to soak up slush and mud from your shoes. Just throw it into the washer once in a while. Be careful to keep it away from the brake, clutch and gas pedals. 16 Obtain a small booklet of sheet protectors to keep a few very important documents safe in your car. Label the outside with the make and model of your car so if it finds its way into the house it is obvious that it needs to be put back into the car. In this booklet of sheet protectors insert the following documents: Insurance summary Registration papers (Write the expiration date in your planner) Safety and Emissions inspection papers Receipts from repairs and maintenance 17 Keep this thin book tucked between the passenger seat and the center console for easy access.

Wrangler drivers not only can take the top down, but they also can take the doors off. This can reduce the weight of the vehicle and improve mileage, and also is an advantage for drivers who need to enter and exit the vehicle many times each day. If you want to learn how to take Jeep doors off, follow these steps. Ad Steps 1 Take off the doors. Door removal is easy on most Jeep models. Loosen the nuts along the bottom of the 2 hinges on each door with a 13mm wrench. If you\u0027re afraid of scratching the paint on the nuts, wrap them in adhesive tape before loosening. Remove the door straps. Open the doors and follow the door restraining straps to the connectors under the dashboard. Gently lift the small red tab at the end of the strap and depress the connector. Then disconnect straps from the restraining hooks. Lift the doors straight off their hinges and set them aside. 2 Remove the mirrors from the doors. Side-view mirrors are bolted to the doors of most Jeep models. You will need to use a mirror-removal kit to take them off the doors and refit them on the vehicle. Use a T40 Torx driver bit to loosen the two heads just below the windshield, near where the side-view mirrors were stationed. Take the mirror plates from the kit and put them in place over the loosened heads. Slowly tighten the heads into the recessed areas of the mirror brackets. Use a 17mm socket wrench to loosen the nuts connecting the mirrors to the doors. Remove the mirrors and set the nuts aside. Attach the mirrors to the black sleeves from the kit and slide them into the brackets. Put the washers from the mirror-removal kit on the bottom of the bolt. Thread the mirror nuts onto the connections and tighten them enough so they don\u0027t swing but can still be adjusted. 3 Turn off dome lights. When you take Jeep doors off, the dome light on your vehicle will stay on. There are several ways to turn off dome lights. Remove the dome-light fuse: Locate your Jeep\u0027s fuse box near the emergency brake pedal. Remove the \"Door Jam Defeat\" fuse to disable the dome light and warning buzzer. Douse the dome light: Install door clips on the dome-light sensor pins inside the door well. Spring-loaded clips fasten securely and eliminate the need to remove fuses.

They also offer privacy from people looking into your car. While tinting is a long, time-consuming process, most people can do tint their own windows with only a few basic tools. Ad Steps Part 1 Preparing the Windows 1 Find a clean, dry work space. You need a clean environment to prevent dust and dirt from mixing with the tinting. Doing everything indoor is not a bad idea. But if you want to work outside, you should choose a clean and dry place. http://pad3.whstatic.com/images/thumb/0/0d/Tint-Car-Windows-Step-1-Version-2.jpg/550px-Tint-Car-Windows-Step-1-Version-2.jpg http://pad2.whstatic.com/images/thumb/0/0d/Tint-Car-Windows-Step-1-Version-2.jpg/300px-Tint-Car-Windows-Step-1-Version-2.jpg //d5kh2btv85w9n.cloudfront.net/0/09/Tint Car Windows Step 1.360p.mp4 2 Remove any stickers or adhesives from the windows. Remove any stickers inside of your car screen and clean off all the adhesives or any sticky things that can create problems with the film sticking on the windows. Remove all the obstructions inside the car that can restrict your process and get in your way. Finally, vacuum the interior to get rid of dust. http://pad2.whstatic.com/images/thumb/5/5a/Tint-Car-Windows-Step-2-Version-2.jpg/550px-Tint-Car-Windows-Step-2-Version-2.jpg http://pad3.whstatic.com/images/thumb/5/5a/Tint-Car-Windows-Step-2-Version-2.jpg/300px-Tint-Car-Windows-Step-2-Version-2.jpg //d5kh2btv85w9n.cloudfront.net/c/c8/Tint Car Windows Step 2.360p.mp4 3 Clean up the windows using soapy water and a 1\" razor blade. Lower the window slightly so that you can get the top as well. Mix a few drops of dish soap with warm water and spray or wipe it on the window, then use the blade to scrape away all the dirt and grime. Make sure you clean both sides of the window well, removing everything. http://pad2.whstatic.com/images/thumb/1/10/Tint-Car-Windows-Step-3-Version-2.jpg/550px-Tint-Car-Windows-Step-3-Version-2.jpg http://pad1.whstatic.com/images/thumb/1/10/Tint-Car-Windows-Step-3-Version-2.jpg/300px-Tint-Car-Windows-Step-3-Version-2.jpg //d5kh2btv85w9n.cloudfront.net/7/7e/Tint Car Windows Step 3.360p.mp4 Never use Windex, or cleaner with ammonia in it. It will tint your windows purple when you\u0027re done. Make sure you get all the edges and seals, and role the window up to get the bottom. You\u0027re going to need almost a gallon of soapy water throughout this process. Prepare the water ahead of time to make working easier. A spray bottle is highly recommended. 4 Take a clean rag and dry the window. Wipe away the soapy water on both sides and dry off the edges as well. If you\u0027re using a spray bottle, refill it with more soapy water. A squeegee will help you get the window completely dry. http://pad1.whstatic.com/images/thumb/c/ce/Tint-Car-Windows-Step-4-Version-2.jpg/550px-Tint-Car-Windows-Step-4-Version-2.jpg http://pad3.whstatic.com/images/thumb/c/ce/Tint-Car-Windows-Step-4-Version-2.jpg/300px-Tint-Car-Windows-Step-4-Version-2.jpg //d5kh2btv85w9n.cloudfront.net/8/89/Tint Car Windows Step 4.360p.mp4 You will need a plenty of soapy water to ensure that the tint doesn\u0027t stick or rip. Make sure you get underneath the seals in the interior of the car. Use your finger to get under the seal and remove dirt and dust. 5 Roll the window back up before beginning, but leave your car on. You\u0027ll need to move the window up and down as you work. For now, leave it up. http://pad1.whstatic.com/images/thumb/3/3a/Tint-Car-Windows-Step-5-Version-2.jpg/550px-Tint-Car-Windows-Step-5-Version-2.jpg http://pad1.whstatic.com/images/thumb/3/3a/Tint-Car-Windows-Step-5-Version-2.jpg/300px-Tint-Car-Windows-Step-5-Version-2.jpg //d5kh2btv85w9n.cloudfront.net/c/ca/Tint Car Windows Step 5.360p.mp4 6 Determine which side of the tint is adhesive. Like a sticker, the tint has a layer that can be peeled off right before adhering it to the window. Make sure, as you work with the tint, that this side is facing you. http://pad3.whstatic.com/images/thumb/b/bc/Tint-Car-Windows-Step-6.jpg/550px-Tint-Car-Windows-Step-6.jpg http://pad3.whstatic.com/images/thumb/b/bc/Tint-Car-Windows-Step-6.jpg/300px-Tint-Car-Windows-Step-6.jpg //d5kh2btv85w9n.cloudfront.net/5/55/Tint Car Windows Step 6.360p.mp4 Part 2 Cutting and Measuring Your Tint 1 Spray the outside of the window with soapy water. The water will help the tinting temporarily adhere, but still make it slippery enough to slide around and put into place. http://pad1.whstatic.com/images/thumb/2/2c/Tint-Car-Windows-Step-7.jpg/550px-Tint-Car-Windows-Step-7.jpg http://pad3.whstatic.com/images/thumb/2/2c/Tint-Car-Windows-Step-7.jpg/300px-Tint-Car-Windows-Step-7.jpg //d5kh2btv85w9n.cloudfront.net/b/bf/Tint Car Windows Step 7.360p.mp4 2 Place the tinting over the outside of the window so that it covers the entire window. Unroll your tinting so that it covers the entire window, with at least 2-3\" of extra tinting over the edges. The liner (the part that will later adhere to the window), should be facing you. http://pad3.whstatic.com/images/thumb/7/78/Tint-Car-Windows-Step-8.jpg/550px-Tint-Car-Windows-Step-8.jpg http://pad1.whstatic.com/images/thumb/7/78/Tint-Car-Windows-Step-8.jpg/300px-Tint-Car-Windows-Step-8.jpg //d5kh2btv85w9n.cloudfront.net/e/eb/Tint Car Windows Step 8.360p.mp4 Make sure you do not remove the liner -- you\u0027re just sizing and pressing the tinting right now, now adhering it. 3 Cut away a manageable slab of tinting. You should have a few inches of extra tint in every direction, but you don\u0027t want to be maneuvering the entire roll of film while working. Use a precision knife or blade to cut a usable square of tinting film from the larger role. http://pad2.whstatic.com/images/thumb/6/6f/Tint-Car-Windows-Step-9.jpg/550px-Tint-Car-Windows-Step-9.jpg http://pad3.whstatic.com/images/thumb/6/6f/Tint-Car-Windows-Step-9.jpg/300px-Tint-Car-Windows-Step-9.jpg //d5kh2btv85w9n.cloudfront.net/e/e7/Tint Car Windows Step 9.360p.mp4 4 Spray the front of the film with water. Once the tint is cut into a square, it should stick to the water on the outside of the window. You should then spray the tint itself so that the entire thing is covered in a thin layer of soapy water. http://pad3.whstatic.com/images/thumb/6/69/Tint-Car-Windows-Step-10.jpg/550px-Tint-Car-Windows-Step-10.jpg http://pad1.whstatic.com/images/thumb/6/69/Tint-Car-Windows-Step-10.jpg/300px-Tint-Car-Windows-Step-10.jpg //d5kh2btv85w9n.cloudfront.net/5/51/Tint Car Windows Step 10.360p.mp4 5 Take your knife and cut along the bottom and left edges of the window. Simply use the edges of the window to trace your knife across the tinting film. You want a perfectly shaped line to ensure the tint fits. When done, two of the edges should fit perfectly, and the rest should still be square. http://pad2.whstatic.com/images/thumb/0/0f/Tint-Car-Windows-Step-11.jpg/550px-Tint-Car-Windows-Step-11.jpg http://pad3.whstatic.com/images/thumb/0/0f/Tint-Car-Windows-Step-11.jpg/300px-Tint-Car-Windows-Step-11.jpg //d5kh2btv85w9n.cloudfront.net/9/90/Tint Car Windows Step 11.360p.mp4 As you cut, use the squeegee or your free hand to make sure the film is flush with the window. When done, cut the excess film away and discard. 6 Pull the film 1\" towards the left edge. You want to shift the film towards the edge you just cut. This ensures that you have enough tint to cover every edge of the window, including the part covered by the seal. http://pad3.whstatic.com/images/thumb/9/98/Tint-Car-Windows-Step-12.jpg/550px-Tint-Car-Windows-Step-12.jpg http://pad1.whstatic.com/images/thumb/9/98/Tint-Car-Windows-Step-12.jpg/300px-Tint-Car-Windows-Step-12.jpg //d5kh2btv85w9n.cloudfront.net/b/b9/Tint Car Windows Step 12.360p.mp4 7 Cut the right edge, then slide the tint halfway back towards the center. Once you slice the right edge off, pull the tint partially back to the center, so that there is roughly 1/2\" of extra tinting film on either side of the window. http://pad3.whstatic.com/images/thumb/e/e8/Tint-Car-Windows-Step-13.jpg/550px-Tint-Car-Windows-Step-13.jpg http://pad1.whstatic.com/images/thumb/e/e8/Tint-Car-Windows-Step-13.jpg/300px-Tint-Car-Windows-Step-13.jpg //d5kh2btv85w9n.cloudfront.net/8/87/Tint Car Windows Step 13.360p.mp4 8 Pull the film down roughly one inch, so the bottom edge is lower than the window. This is the tint that will eventually go into the door, allowing you a better light seal. Slide it down and then use the squeegee to flatten it again. You\u0027ll be doing the same thing you just did with the right and left side on the top and bottom edges. http://pad3.whstatic.com/images/thumb/4/4d/Tint-Car-Windows-Step-14.jpg/550px-Tint-Car-Windows-Step-14.jpg http://pad1.whstatic.com/images/thumb/4/4d/Tint-Car-Windows-Step-14.jpg/300px-Tint-Car-Windows-Step-14.jpg //d5kh2btv85w9n.cloudfront.net/8/8c/Tint Car Windows Step 14.360p.mp4 9 Lower the window a half inch, then use the top of the window to cut the film to shape. Once the window is lowered, you can use this top edge of the window as your guide. Use the precision knife to cut right to the top of the window. When done, pull the tint back towards the center. You should have roughly 1/2\" of extra film on every side of the window. http://pad3.whstatic.com/images/thumb/f/f4/Tint-Car-Windows-Step-15.jpg/550px-Tint-Car-Windows-Step-15.jpg http://pad1.whstatic.com/images/thumb/f/f4/Tint-Car-Windows-Step-15.jpg/300px-Tint-Car-Windows-Step-15.jpg //d5kh2btv85w9n.cloudfront.net/8/8c/Tint Car Windows Step 15.360p.mp4 10 Clean up any of the corners that have excess film. When cutting away, the corners may have bits and pieces of extra film in the corners. Use your knife to clean it all up. http://pad2.whstatic.com/images/thumb/e/e9/Tint-Car-Windows-Step-16.jpg/550px-Tint-Car-Windows-Step-16.jpg http://pad3.whstatic.com/images/thumb/e/e9/Tint-Car-Windows-Step-16.jpg/300px-Tint-Car-Windows-Step-16.jpg //d5kh2btv85w9n.cloudfront.net/1/13/Tint Car Windows Step 16.360p.mp4 11 Realign your film so that it fits the window perfectly, with some excess on every edge. You may need to reapply water to make it stick. If so, remove the cut tint, spray some more soapy water, and reapply the film to the window. http://pad2.whstatic.com/images/thumb/1/16/Tint-Car-Windows-Step-17.jpg/550px-Tint-Car-Windows-Step-17.jpg http://pad1.whstatic.com/images/thumb/1/16/Tint-Car-Windows-Step-17.jpg/300px-Tint-Car-Windows-Step-17.jpg //d5kh2btv85w9n.cloudfront.net/a/ae/Tint Car Windows Step 17.360p.mp4 12 Working from the top down, use a heat gun and a hard card to push the bubbles to the bottom. Get out all the air and water by working from the top downward. Smooth the entire film out on the outside of the window. As you push to the bottom, you\u0027ll see zig-zagging from the \"fingers\" of air still stuck in the film. This is a good sign. Keep pushing downward, then run the heat gun along the bottom of the window to make sure it is all dried out. http://pad3.whstatic.com/images/thumb/6/63/Tint-Car-Windows-Step-18.jpg/550px-Tint-Car-Windows-Step-18.jpg http://pad3.whstatic.com/images/thumb/6/63/Tint-Car-Windows-Step-18.jpg/300px-Tint-Car-Windows-Step-18.jpg //d5kh2btv85w9n.cloudfront.net/4/43/Tint Car Windows Step 18.360p.mp4 You can leave the tint stuck to the outside of the window now. You\u0027ll have to prep the inside window a bit more, so this is a good place to ensure that the tint stays dust free. Part 3 Adhering the Tint 1 Prep the inside of the window with soapy water and a squeegee. You\u0027re going to go through a lot of soapy water in this process. You can use a hard edge to get in between the seal and the window for a better clean. When done, spray the whole window with soapy water. http://pad2.whstatic.com/images/thumb/e/ef/Tint-Car-Windows-Step-19.jpg/550px-Tint-Car-Windows-Step-19.jpg http://pad2.whstatic.com/images/thumb/e/ef/Tint-Car-Windows-Step-19.jpg/300px-Tint-Car-Windows-Step-19.jpg //d5kh2btv85w9n.cloudfront.net/2/26/Tint Car Windows Step 19.360p.mp4 2 Peel off the top half of the release liner from the tinting film. Window tint works just like a sticker. There is a removable layer that adheres to the tint and keeps the adhesive solid. You should, however, only peel off only the top half for now-- it makes it easier to work with. http://pad1.whstatic.com/images/thumb/3/36/Tint-Car-Windows-Step-20.jpg/550px-Tint-Car-Windows-Step-20.jpg http://pad3.whstatic.com/images/thumb/3/36/Tint-Car-Windows-Step-20.jpg/300px-Tint-Car-Windows-Step-20.jpg //d5kh2btv85w9n.cloudfront.net/1/1c/Tint Car Windows Step 20.360p.mp4 Just gently work the tint between two fingers like you were snapping to get the adhesive layer off. 3 Spray off the now-exposed section with fresh water. You are now ready to adhere the tint to the window. http://pad3.whstatic.com/images/thumb/1/1b/Tint-Car-Windows-Step-21.jpg/550px-Tint-Car-Windows-Step-21.jpg http://pad1.whstatic.com/images/thumb/1/1b/Tint-Car-Windows-Step-21.jpg/300px-Tint-Car-Windows-Step-21.jpg //d5kh2btv85w9n.cloudfront.net/5/5b/Tint Car Windows Step 21.360p.mp4 4 Line up and adhere the top of the tint to the window. The water makes the tint easy to slide around, so you can get the edge of the window perfectly lined up with the top edge of the tint. Your window should still be slightly down. http://pad2.whstatic.com/images/thumb/5/58/Tint-Car-Windows-Step-22.jpg/550px-Tint-Car-Windows-Step-22.jpg http://pad2.whstatic.com/images/thumb/5/58/Tint-Car-Windows-Step-22.jpg/300px-Tint-Car-Windows-Step-22.jpg //d5kh2btv85w9n.cloudfront.net/0/02/Tint Car Windows Step 22.360p.mp4 5 Slightly fold the tint to work it underneath the seal. Once the top edge is on the window, sneak the two sides into the seals to the right and left, using your fingers to get them roughly flush. With one hand, pull back the seal around the window, then use the other hand to push the film under the seal and onto the window. http://pad2.whstatic.com/images/thumb/2/2f/Tint-Car-Windows-Step-23.jpg/550px-Tint-Car-Windows-Step-23.jpg http://pad1.whstatic.com/images/thumb/2/2f/Tint-Car-Windows-Step-23.jpg/300px-Tint-Car-Windows-Step-23.jpg //d5kh2btv85w9n.cloudfront.net/5/56/Tint Car Windows Step 23.360p.mp4 Remember to keep everything doused in soapy water to make it easier to move around. 6 Spray down the window again, then use your hard edge to push the water out the edges. Using your squeegee or hard-edge, slowly work the water out by pushing the water to the sides. Push the water out the top and sides, but don\u0027t push towards the bottom, where you have the rest of you liner waiting to be adhered. http://pad3.whstatic.com/images/thumb/4/46/Tint-Car-Windows-Step-24.jpg/550px-Tint-Car-Windows-Step-24.jpg http://pad1.whstatic.com/images/thumb/4/46/Tint-Car-Windows-Step-24.jpg/300px-Tint-Car-Windows-Step-24.jpg //d5kh2btv85w9n.cloudfront.net/c/c3/Tint Car Windows Step 24.360p.mp4 You should keep a hand on the tint at all times to keep it from moving as you squeegee the water out. 7 Roll the window up, then spray the bottom half of the window with soapy water. Don\u0027t skimp on the soapy water -- it is essential to prevent the tint from sticking. http://pad3.whstatic.com/images/thumb/d/d0/Tint-Car-Windows-Step-25.jpg/550px-Tint-Car-Windows-Step-25.jpg http://pad3.whstatic.com/images/thumb/d/d0/Tint-Car-Windows-Step-25.jpg/300px-Tint-Car-Windows-Step-25.jpg //d5kh2btv85w9n.cloudfront.net/8/81/Tint Car Windows Step 25.360p.mp4 8 Pull of the remaining release layer, then spray the exposed tint with water. Make sure both the window and the tint are wet. http://pad1.whstatic.com/images/thumb/e/ef/Tint-Car-Windows-Step-26.jpg/550px-Tint-Car-Windows-Step-26.jpg http://pad2.whstatic.com/images/thumb/e/ef/Tint-Car-Windows-Step-26.jpg/300px-Tint-Car-Windows-Step-26.jpg //d5kh2btv85w9n.cloudfront.net/7/78/Tint Car Windows Step 26.360p.mp4 9 Use your fingers and hard edge to tuck the bottom of the tint into the bottom seal. Spray off the tint with soapy water again. This is tricky, but should be easy with a hard edge. Pull back the seal with your fingers, then use the hard edge to push the film down and onto the window. http://pad2.whstatic.com/images/thumb/e/e0/Tint-Car-Windows-Step-27.jpg/550px-Tint-Car-Windows-Step-27.jpg http://pad3.whstatic.com/images/thumb/e/e0/Tint-Car-Windows-Step-27.jpg/300px-Tint-Car-Windows-Step-27.jpg //d5kh2btv85w9n.cloudfront.net/5/56/Tint Car Windows Step 27.360p.mp4 10 Smooth out the window with your hard edge, pushing all the water and air bubbles towards the edges. Work downward and outward whenever possible, spraying the tint with more soapy water to make sure you don\u0027t rip the liner. Keep squeegeeing the water out of the tinting so that it is smooth, as if it was just a part of the window.[1] http://pad2.whstatic.com/images/thumb/f/f6/Tint-Car-Windows-Step-28.jpg/550px-Tint-Car-Windows-Step-28.jpg http://pad3.whstatic.com/images/thumb/f/f6/Tint-Car-Windows-Step-28.jpg/300px-Tint-Car-Windows-Step-28.jpg //d5kh2btv85w9n.cloudfront.net/2/20/Tint Car Windows Step 28.360p.mp4 Reader Questions and Answers Unanswered Questions Show more unanswered questions Add New Question Answered Questions Don\u0027t see your question?

Debris from the road kicks up while driving to chip the sides, adverse weather can wreak havoc on the hood, and accidents can happen any time. A car in use is bound to obtain a few paint chips. These chips are usually too small to warrant a new paint job or professional assistance at all. If the affected area is smaller than a pencil eraser, you can use touch-up paint to repair the damage. Use these steps to touch up car paint. Ad Steps 1 Buy a matching touch-up paint color. Check the firewall (bulkhead) to find the paint code number. The firewall is the piece of sheet metal that separates the engine under the hood from the passengers inside the vehicle. You will need to open your hood to find this number. Purchase a primer along with the touch-up paint unless the particular touch-up paint you\u0027ve chosen states otherwise. Touch-up paint and primer can be purchased at auto stores. 2 Check the affected area for rust. Apply a small amount of rust arrestor on the chipped area before touching it up to prevent rust from spreading underneath your touch-up job. 3 Wash the car, focusing on the area where the paint is chipped. 4 Pre-treat the chip. Apply wax remover to the area. Use a nick sander to remove all loose paint from the area. Sand the area again with number 220 sandpaper. This will allow the primer to stick. Wash the area once more with water to remove the wax and any leftover debris from the pre-treating process. Allow the area to dry thoroughly before moving on to the next step. 5 Apply primer if necessary. Squeeze a dab of primer onto the area if the chip reaches metal. If the chip is surface-level, you can skip this step. Primer is needed for deep chips because regular paint will not adhere to bare metal. Spread the primer around the small chip with a tiny brush. Only use enough primer for one thin coat. Allow the primer to dry completely. 6 Test the paint. Apply some of the paint to an area on the car that isn\u0027t visible, such as the lip under a door. It is important to make sure the paint you\u0027ve purchased will not react poorly to your existing paint and also that it matches well. 7 Paint the primed area. Shake the paint well and pour some into a shallow dish. Spread 2 to 3 layers of touch-up paint on the area. The touched-up spot will look elevated above the rest of the paint, which is how it should look. Wait at least 24 hours before continuing the process. 8 Finish the surface. Sand the area with 1000-grit sandpaper, making sure to move very slowly and gently. Continue with 2000-grit and 3000-grit until the touch-up paint is even with the rest of the vehicle. Polish and wax the entire car. Reader Questions and Answers Unanswered Questions Show more unanswered questions Add New Question Answered Questions Don\u0027t see your question?

If you\u0027re willing to invest the time and care, you can do a professional job yourself by following these steps. Ad Steps 1 Shop for paint that matches your car\u0027s color exactly. Look in the owner\u0027s manual for a factory paint code. If you can\u0027t find it there, try asking your dealer or the local auto parts store. Buy a bottle of touch-up paint at that store. 2 Go to an art store and buy a small artist\u0027s paintbrush (#2 is a good size). Don\u0027t use the fat brush that comes with the touch-up paint. It\u0027s too big for the detailing work you\u0027ll need to do on the scratch. 3 Test the touch-up paint on an inconspicuous area of your car. You want to make sure the paint matches. Even if you got the factory paint code, your car\u0027s color may have lightened from exposure to sun, and you might need a lighter shade. You don\u0027t want to wait to find out the hard way after putting the paint over your scratch that the paint doesn\u0027t match! 4 Clean the scratched area gently but thoroughly. Use a cloth and mild soap and water. When you fill in the scratch, you don\u0027t want to seal any dirt in there. You also don\u0027t want to seal up any moisture, so make sure to let the spot dry completely before proceeding to the next step. It\u0027s recommended that you do this the day before fixing the scratch, so the car can dry overnight. 5 Spray degreaser onto a rag and apply it to the scratched area. This will remove any grease or wax in the spot. 6 Check if the scratch has any loose edges. Run a toothpick along the edges, and if there is any loose paint, push it off with the toothpick. 7 Smooth the scratch with sandpaper. If the scratch is small, you can make a sanding pencil by hole-punching a dot out of 1200-grit wet and dry sandpaper and gluing it to a pencil eraser with rubber cement. Allow this to dry overnight before using. Right before using this sanding pencil, dip it into water and gently rotate the sanding pencil over the scratch. 8 Clean the area of with denatured alcohol and a foam swab. 9 Apply primer if metal is exposed. Dip the tip of a toothpick in the primer, then apply to the center of the scratch or chip, allowing the primer to fill in the exposed metal. Use a small enough amount of primer so that it doesn\u0027t overflow the sides of the scratch or chip. Allow to dry for two to three hours. You may also want to apply polishing compound. 10 Apply the touch-up paint with a #2 paintbrush. Again, apply a small amount. Allow to dry for two to three hours, then repeat until the scratch is filled. When you\u0027re done, the paint should only slightly overfill into the area surrounding the scratch. Allow to dry for at least 24 hours. 11 Use 2000- or 2500-grit paper and a sanding block to level the scratch. 12 Buff the area with a good polish.

These steps will maximise power, reduce fuel consumption and reduce the chance of overheating. Ad Steps 1 Obtain information about ignition point gaps, firing order, timing advance and spark plug gaps from the car manual or other reliable source. 2 Buy replacement spark plugs, ignition points, ignition leads, condensers as needed. Mostly these will not be required, though it is best to replace the ignition points. 3 Start with a clean engine. If the spark plug leads are not already numbered, use a marker to do so. This can be wiped off later if you like. No.1 cylinder is at the front of the car. With transverse motors No.1 cylinder is nearest the radiator. 4 Note where the No.1 lead enters the distributor cap. 5 Grasp each spark plug lead at the plug end as close to the motor as you can get and pull straight out. This prevents damage to the connector. Do not bend the leads sharply as this can wreck the carbon based inner conductor. 6 Use a proper spark plug wrench to loosen every spark plug and remove them. 7 Check the spark plugs. If the electrodes are severely rounded off or the insulators are damaged, do not re-use. 8 Scrub the plugs with a wire brush and rinse with gasoline/petrol or kerosene and set to dry if you wish to re-use. 9 Set a feeler gauge to the required gap and place between the centre electrode and the side one. Do not attempt to adjust the centre electrode. Bend the outside one with pliers to open, tap gently on a firm surface to close. A firm sliding fit with the gauge square to the plug shows the correct gap. 10 Remove the distributor cap. You will see a central shaft with a Bakelite rotor above it. This rotor points to the appropriate contact on the inside of the cap as each spark plug fires. Lift the rotor off, be careful that small parts do not drop off. Wipe the contact areas of the rotor with a coarse rag or one stroke along the edge of a matchbox, no more. 11 Inspect the interior of the distributor cap for dirt, cracks, moisture and carbon tracks. If there are carbon tracks or cracks, replace the cap. Otherwise wipe clean, remove deposits from the electrodes and set aside. 12 The ignition points will be held in with two screws. Note that one can be used to set the gap, the other holds the points in place. A wire from the outside of the distributor connects to the condenser and the ignition switch. 13 Remove the ignition points, being careful to note the position and number of any insulating and other washers fitted. 14 Inspect the points for pitting and deposits. Slight pitting is normal and may be dressed off square with a file. The points may then be re-used. 15 Pack the angle where the points assembly slides over the cam on the distributor shaft (the follower) with a little blob of high temperature grease. This often comes with a new set of points. Wheel bearing grease may be used. Do not use oil, ordinary grease or petroleum jelly as the spinning shaft will throw the lubricant off and it can get between the points. 16 Look for the centrifugal ignition advance weights which may be partially visible below the baseplate. Give them a gentle poke with a screwdriver to ensure they have not jammed up. There may be a hole marked \"Oil\" to lubricate them. Two drops of engine oil is enough. Wipe up any oil spillage. 17 Replace the points on the baseplate with washers in the correct places. Put the screws in firmly but do not fully tighten them yet. 18 Rotate the engine clockwise with the spark plugs out and the transmission in neutral (looking from the engine rear)so that the follower is at the top of a shaft cam lobe. Use a wrench/spanner on the hexagon at the bottom pulley. 19 Set a feeler gauge to the correct points gap and wipe it so that it is free of dirt and oil. Place in the gap of the points and tighten the points screws. You will almost certainly not get the gap correct the first time so repeat until the gap is correct. 20 Replace the rotor cap and rotate the engine clockwise until the timing marks on the bottom pulley are opposite the marks on the front of the engine. The rotor cap must be pointing to the position of the No. 1 plug lead. This may take more than one full rotation of the engine as the distributor shaft rotates at half the engine speed. 21 The spark plug fires as the points just begin to open. This should be shortly before the piston reaches top dead centre. The advance is measured in degrees and is usually around 8 to 15. The bottom pulley may have two marks with a single mark on the motor front. The first of these marks is the correct one, the second corresponds to top dead centre. Match the mark on the pulley with that on the engine. 22 Alternately there is one mark on the pulley and two or more marks on the engine. Select the correct mark on the engine and match it up with the mark on the pulley. From the front of the engine this will be clockwise of the mark for top dead centre. 23 Loosen the distributor at the fitting on the shaft below the body. Alternately use the vernier adjustment if fitted. 24 Connect a 12 Volt trouble light to a good ground and to the terminal outside the distributor where the condenser connects. Be sure the spark plugs are out of the engine. Switch on the ignition but do not crank the engine. 25 While the points are closed, the lamp will be out or glowing dimly. With the points open, it will glow brightly. 26 With the rotor cap pointing to No.1 position, rotate the distributor slightly or use the vernier so that the lamp just lights. Switch off the ignition and tighten the distributor without moving it. 27 Disconnect the tube to the vacuum advance diaphragm from the fuel system and suck on the tube. If the distributor baseplate moves, the vacuum advance is working adequately. Reconnect the tube. If the tube is holed, replace it. 28 Inspect the spark plug leads. Burnt-looking connectors indicate loose connections. Replace the lead or take off the connector, clean, cut 2cm or 3/4 inch of lead away and replace the connector. Wipe the leads clean of dirt and oil. 29 Replace the spark plugs, distributor cap and plug leads in the correct order. Carefully thread the spark plugs in, hand tighten then a twitch with a wrench is all that is needed. 30 Start the engine. If it does not start, have you replaced the rotor cap? 31 Have you replaced the rotor?

If the spark plug electrodes are severely rounded off, this could indicate extreme age, a too-lean fuel mixture or that the plugs are too \"hot\" a rating for the engine. This static timing method produces as good a result as a stroboscopic timing lamp in almost all cases. Severe pitting and erosion of ignition points indicates that the points were set too close or that the condenser is defective. Inspect used spark plugs for presence of oil, which indicates a worn or broken piston ring or worn valve guides. Carbon indicates a too-rich mixture from the carburetor or a lot of short runs on a cold motor. Water indicates a blown head gasket.

It will say System on \"Theft System\" or something similar. 2 Make sure nothing is loose if you tried to take anything apart. 3 Check to see if the battery has not been drained. At that point the car will not do any thing, except make a slight effort to start. If the battery is dead, ask someone to help jump start it for you. 4 Place the key in the ignition, and turn it slightly to the right. This is also known as position 2, in which the car is on but the engine is off. This gives power to the necessary components to allow this method of bypassing the alarm to work. When you turn the key the radio should work, and the dash lights should light up. 5 Keep the key that way for ten minutes, maybe a little more. The theft system light should turn off, and the car can be started. Method 2 Turning the Theft System Off Outside of the Car 1 Insert the key in the driver\u0027s side door.

Statistically, they reduce injury in an automobile accident by approximately 30 percent. Now they are required to be located on both the driver and passenger\u0027s side of the car. These cushions inflate about 50 milliseconds after a collision in order to form a protective pillow and lessen the impact of the whiplash momentum a crash creates. It can help to be aware of how air bags work in order to understand how they can be beneficial during a collision, and also so you can choose whether you want them turned off or on, depending upon who is sitting in your car. This article will tell you how to understand how automotive air bags work. Imagine you have just had a collision with another car in order to understand the process. Ad Steps 1 Learn how a collision with a hard object triggers the airbag. There are electronic sensors in the front of your car that detect this collision within seconds. The force required to activate the sensor is equal to running into a rock wall at the speed of 10 miles (16 km) per hour. 2 Understand the signal\u0027s job is to tell a microchip to detonate a canister filled with sodium azide (NaN3) and combine it with potassium nitrate (KNO3). This chemical reaction forms nitrogen gas. Sodium azide is a stable compound unless it is heated. The chemical reaction process creates the heat required to make it unstable. Once it is heated sodium azide can be toxic to the compounds, so automobile manufacturers mix the sodium azide with other chemicals to lessen the effect once the airbag is inflated. 3 Understand that heated blasts of nitrogen gas from this chemical reaction inflate a nylon airbag. This thin bag is stored inside the dashboard, steering wheel or door. It is filled at approximately the velocity of 150 to 250 miles (240 to 402 km) per hour. The bags usually also release a powdery substance, like cornstarch, when they are released. The nylon is stored in this powder in order to keep it pliable until the point of impact. 4 Learn that the airbag begins to deflate immediately upon inflation. This makes sure that both the head and torso hit a pillow-like surface, rather than a hard surface. Reader Questions and Answers Unanswered Questions Show more unanswered questions Add New Question Answered Questions Don\u0027t see your question? Ask it here: Submit Tips Air bags were created to be used with seat belts. They are meant to further dampen the impact after the seat belt has done its job to hold the driver or passenger in place. Researchers suggest that the driver should sit at least 10 inches (25 cm) behind the steering wheel. Sitting closer can cause damage to the driver upon impact with the steering wheel. Slightly recline your seat so that the front airbag points toward your chest, rather than your head. This can also lessen the chance of airbag injury and help to absorb the majority of the shock of the collision. You may be able to deactivate your airbag. This is recommended if you must carry infants in the front seat or if you have certain medical conditions, such as a pacemaker, angina, eyeglasses, mastectomy, emphysema, back or neck surgeries, pregnancy or osteoporosis. Warnings Children under 12 years old should not be placed in the front of the car. Both collisions and the impact of air bags can be harmful to small children. Sitting in the back of the car should absorb more impact than being seated at the front, in most cars.

Make sure you learn a few things before making some common \"noob\" mistakes. Ad Steps 1 The first thing you need to do is a complete a tune up. 2 Replace all worn belts, including the timing belt and balance shaft belt. 3 If the timing belt/balance shaft belt haven\u0027t been replaced within the last 60k miles, or you\u0027re not sure when they were last changed - change them now. If they break, you\u0027ll be paying for a cylinder head rebuild (not cheap). 4 You\u0027ll also want to change out all filters, fluids, worn hoses, spark plugs/wires, and worn/leaking gaskets. 5 Check the compression, do a leak-down test, check your ignition timing, etc. 6 Basically, do all of the checks that your repair manual tells you to do - you do have a repair manual already, don\u0027t you? If not, pick one up now before moving forward with any modifications. 7 Once you\u0027ve gotten all of the necessary maintenance out of the way, you can start with the modifications. We\u0027ve broken it down into two common stages to help you achieve your goals gradually.Before you start shopping for big turbos, intakes and headers, read our article on the common mistakes and misconceptions by newbie and read the staged upgrade paths to the right. Reader Questions and Answers Unanswered Questions Show more unanswered questions Add New Question Answered Questions Don\u0027t see your question? Ask it here: Submit Tips Raising boost too much, too soon It is well known that raising the boost levels is the quickest and easiest way to raise your horsepower. It\u0027s also a quick way to mess things up and hit \"fuel cut\" (when the ECU cuts fuel at WOT when your boost is too high). If you raise your boost levels with a boost controller, be sure you\u0027ve first installed an aftermarket boost gauge. It is critical, as the stock gauge is not a true boost gauge. Also, if you have not made any changes to your fuel system (fuel pump or injectors), do not raise your boost any higher than 16psi. That is all the stock fuel system is able to handle. Maintenance - Rubber hoses dry out, timing belts need religious replacement, oil, gear lube, coolant, and brake fluid have limited lifespans, and most parts end up needing replacement to work correctly. If you don\u0027t know when they were changed last, change them. If you don\u0027t take good care of your car, you deserve the problems that will arise from such neglect. Intakes and Headers Many people coming from the Honda world quickly start asking about which intakes and headers are available. This is because those mods have always been common in other import non-turbo applications. The intakes on turbocharged can be replaced, but aren\u0027t significant power-adders. Changing filters is very important though, and is recommended early on. The factory exhaust manifold is more than adequate though, with some porting work (except the 1G crack-prone manifolds, which should be replaced with a ported 2G manifold). Trust me, it\u0027s the rest of the exhaust that needs attention, not the manifold. Big turbos - not a good first mod.You can not add a larger turbo to your system without adding several other parts first. If you do so without adding the appropriate modifications, the turbo will not give you any more power than you already have.If you add the proper supporting mods first, the car will have significantly more power without even touching the turbo. We\u0027ve common stages to help you achieve your goals gradually.Before you start shopping for big turbos, intakes and headers, read our article on the common mistakes and misconceptions by newbie and read the staged upgrade paths to the right. Loud BOVs (the Humming sound between shifts) The second most common question is, \"how do I make my BOV louder?\".A louder BOV on these cars will conflict with vehicle performance. In order to make a BOV loud, you have to vent to the atmosphere (as opposed to back into the intake, like our cars do from the factory), releasing the excess air instead of routing it back into your turbo system. The problem is, your ECU has already accounted for this \"excess air\" and adjusts fuel curves accordingly. If it\u0027s not in the system anymore, the ECU is compensating incorrectly. This means that the car will not run the way it\u0027s supposed to. It may idle poorly, or it may not be noticeable - but it will have a negative effect, even if you can\u0027t feel it (the logger will prove it). In any event, it is not the best thing to do if you are serious about making maximum performance. And if you are more interested in making your car sound \"furious\" and not making it \"fast\", expect a good deal of heckling, as this is a performance community. Warnings A few things to keep in mind when you start modding: Set a goal/budget before buying any parts. Solid plan \u003d more money later. Be realistic with those goals and plans. What will your car be used for? There is no \"best\" part when it comes to modding. Find out the emissions requirements in your area before choosing parts. Do your research before you buy parts - make sure the parts you buy will work together well. Usable power under the curve is important, not just big overall horsepower numbers.

Small dents and scratches can appear if you don’t use total precision when backing in and out of the garage, which could add up to a nice sum of money. Instead of having to fight the garage walls day in and day out, why not pad the walls with something as simple as a foam pool noodle? It’s a quick, easy and most importantly, inexpensive way to protect your car. Ad Steps 1 Cut pool noodle in half, lengthwise. You will end up with 2 long, hollow pieces. Take safety precautions when cutting the noodle in half, keeping fingers away from the blade. Lay noodle on a hard surface to cut in half. Identify the middle of the rounded piece first before cutting. 2 Identify the most vulnerable areas in the garage. Certainly the entire wall isn’t a usual offender, but perhaps there is one area that seems to get dinged the most (typically the area where car doors are opened and closed). Use your tape measure to determine the specific height of your car door. Keep in mind that SUV doors are considerably higher than doors on a sedan. 3 Mark off the area where pool noodled will be mounted. Using your measuring tape and pencil, draw a straight line that denotes where the pool noodle should be located. Ask an assistant to hold the noodle in place and test out the position before making it permanent. Open and close door in the area to ensure you are on target. 4 Mount noodle to wall. Apply ample glue to the back of the pool noodle and then hold it firmly in place on the target wall. Hold for up to 10 minutes or until you know that the glue has adhered to the noodle and wall.
